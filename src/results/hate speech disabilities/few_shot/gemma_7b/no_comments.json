            "The other interesting thing is that when you ask people to come up with an argument for why incest is immoral, it's usually *really* tough for people to come up with one that doesn't apply to other relationships in problematic ways.   [linebreak]  [linebreak] Like, the  first thing people turn to is usually the risk of birth defects (which is probably one of the reason that we have a built in level of aversion to incest), but does that really apply in an age when contraception is readily available and widely used?  If risk of birth defects in children makes incest wrong, does that mean it's wrong for people with dwarfism to have sex? [linebreak]  [linebreak] Same thing goes for power dynamics and grooming.  These are problems independent of incest, and ones aren't inherent if you're talking about similarly aged cousins or siblings. [linebreak]  [linebreak] I myself haven't really been able to come up with a strong argument for it being inherently wrong.",
            "Methinks electr0smith is referring to PETA's notorious zeal in culling domesticated animals. [linebreak]  [linebreak] Killing off adoptable pets, even going as far as to *steal pets and kill them*, serves no practical purpose at all except in the deranged minds of these animal \"rights\" nutjobs. Their end goal is to keep people from having any sort of interaction with animals, at all. Not as farm animals, not as service animals, not as pets.",
            "Everyone's so worried about *school shooters that they caused**to care that more people die from suicide by gun than anything else in America. [linebreak]  [linebreak] Real mental health awareness could save a lot of lives in this country. Imagine if everyone got the help they needed?  People could have meaningful relationships. People could enjoy things again. People would stop killing themselves and each other in droves. [linebreak]  [linebreak] Edit: * *There's a difference between psycho spree shooters and a shooters who wants revenge for being tormented. [linebreak]  [linebreak] It's a touchy subject but if you don't make the distinction you can't put the blame where it really belongs.  Psychos are psycho. They're going to kill someone or something.* It's all a matter of when.* and it's rare when they're caught before they do something because they come off as normal teenage outcasts. [linebreak]  [linebreak] As for the bullied shooters. [linebreak] *Did anyone ever think they went too far with their bullying before their classmate pulled a gun?* [linebreak] Did the school staff notice ? Or did they let him / her fall through the cracks into a void of misery and depression? Did anyone even bother to make the effort to reach out to them ? [linebreak]  [linebreak] I'm just tired of this hindsight is 20/20 bullshit. Bullied shooters can be prevented if we all stopped being assholes to each other.",
