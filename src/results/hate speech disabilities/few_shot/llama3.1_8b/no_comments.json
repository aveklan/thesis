            "The other interesting thing is that when you ask people to come up with an argument for why incest is immoral, it's usually *really* tough for people to come up with one that doesn't apply to other relationships in problematic ways.   [linebreak]  [linebreak] Like, the  first thing people turn to is usually the risk of birth defects (which is probably one of the reason that we have a built in level of aversion to incest), but does that really apply in an age when contraception is readily available and widely used?  If risk of birth defects in children makes incest wrong, does that mean it's wrong for people with dwarfism to have sex? [linebreak]  [linebreak] Same thing goes for power dynamics and grooming.  These are problems independent of incest, and ones aren't inherent if you're talking about similarly aged cousins or siblings. [linebreak]  [linebreak] I myself haven't really been able to come up with a strong argument for it being inherently wrong.",

            "Anyone old enough to remember Youtube when it was dominated by the likes of *Smosh* and other amateur content creators probably scoffs at how *soft* the internet has become. Before graduating high school, I had spoken with Islamic fundamentalists, spammed the likes of David Duke for fun, had no fewer than four people threaten to injure or kill me (one of those also provided a graphic description of how he would rape and kill my family in front of me), and had my first exposure to what would later be deemed by /pol/ as the *schizoboomer* - the archetypal crazy person who insisted to me that he had 'top government contacts' in the British military who *assured him* that the 2012 Mayan apocalypse was real and not a viral marketing campaign for a lackluster Roland Emmerich movie. Youtube's moderation staff at the time was notoriously slow, and never really kept up with scale. By around the 2010s, it became obvious to anyone paying attention that Youtube had become a sump for some dangerously insane individuals. [linebreak]  [linebreak] It was also obvious that the moderation team could never possibly scale to deal with the completely depersonalized nature of these comment sections - they would have to read the comments to get context on the conversation and *then* ban the offending users, who would have a new account set up in minutes (this was before the move towards 2 factor verification across most services, so it was really, really easy back then, comparable to making a new Reddit account today). [linebreak]  [linebreak] This was a problem that social networks and MMOs would find increasingly difficult to grapple with, especially as more dedicated persons learned methods of subverting filters and behavior guidelines (the emergence of the now-cheapened term 'trolling,' perhaps best exemplified by the [4chan raids on Habbo Hotel](https://i.redd.it/9hw4i24r9t231.jpg)). It was remarkably easy to get away with this sort of thing at the time. [linebreak]  [linebreak] For Youtube, the solution seems to be in a crowd-sourced pseudo-AI analyzing viewing patterns and social networks in order to determine who is likely to constitute an undesirable, and removing them. This, in tandem with surgical bans against particularly egregious focal points of dissidence (e.g. Alex Jones) has been their operating strategy ever since it became clear that they could never *read* nor even *watch* all the content they were hosting. [linebreak]  [linebreak] Reddit has taken another approach. Although it has made use of surgical bannings (notably against /r/FatPeopleHate, /r/MDE, and /r/AltRight), it does not have the resources to make use of the more sophisticated methods used by Google. Instead, it relies upon simple social manipulation. Reddit made two important changes to its platform which all but ensured it was destined to become an echo chamber of its young and left-leaning user base - first, the decision to present upvotes and downvotes *as an aggregate* rather than separately. Whereas it had previously been possible to see the numerical level of support *for* or *against* an idea, now it is only possible to view whether or not an idea has positive or negative karma - i.e. it is only possible to see whether or not the majority agreed or disagreed with the idea. The minority opinion thus becomes merely an unpopular opinion - it becomes impossible for the minority to ascertain whether or not there is a minority who actually *support* their ideas. [linebreak]  [linebreak] Second comes the cool down timer - when users with negative karma in a subreddit try to make a comment, they are often met with the response that \"You are doing that too much. Try again in 10 minutes.\" This was (as far as I understand) originally intended as a hedge against overt trolling and thread derailment, but it has had the effect of creating a series of walled-gardens that no longer really talk to each other outside of dedicated debate subreddits without a clear bias towards one group. Once a group comes to dominate the conversation, they begin to 'settle in' to the subreddit and frequent it more (/r/DebateReligion is an example of what was once a very high quality subreddit with a variety of viewpoints that has recently become dominated by lazily scrawled critiques by 14 year old atheists). It also becomes impossible for unpopular discourse to advance itself, because newer arrivals are downvoted and only have the chance to post six times every hour - this can often lead to situations where multiple people *respond* to an unpopular post, but only one or two get an answer, making it initially appear as though the point has been refuted by virtue of the dissident's silence - it's structurally impossible for them to offer timely replies. [linebreak]  [linebreak] All of this seems to me to be very much intentional - and I don't doubt there will be lots of readers on /r/TheoryOfReddit who will claim that the system is functioning as intended (because to them, these ideas are invalid and thus should not be engaged with anyways, which incidentally is exactly how we've ended up with so many schizoboomers on /pol/ over the years).",

At bottom is a passionate nationalism. Allied to it is a conspiratorial and Manichean view of history as a battle between the good and evil camps, between the pure and the corrupt, in which one's own community or nation has been the victim.
