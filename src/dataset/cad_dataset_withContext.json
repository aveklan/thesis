Such as \"the condition of feeling one's emotional and psychological identity as male or female to be opposite to one's biological sex.\" it's weird that such an intersectional definition comes (besides the fact that it ignores nonbinaries) is from the racist and sexist Google dictionary that says sexism can apply to men and racism can apply to white people. [linebreak]  [linebreak] 2. Dysphoria is the will to be the opposite gender and transgender is the will to be the opposite gender. You might notice that it is the same thing. It is like calling the size of paper a \"non-ledger tabloid\" (don't get me started about paper sizes) [linebreak]  [linebreak] 3. It makes dysphoria meaningless. Thousands of people are dysphoric and suffer from it. Even the broad dysphoria definition proposed ontop can cause psychological problems. Why make the word meaningless? [linebreak]  [linebreak] 4. (mostly a counter to point 6) most transphobic people's argument is \"you gender is unrelated to how you feel\". The word Dysphoria helps people understand that it is a quantifiable studied phenomenon. What do you think will generate more transphobia, saying gender is a feeling or saying gender is a mental state. [linebreak]  [linebreak] 5. I don't believe in cultural appropriation but I assume the Tumblr person does. So is non dysphoric transgenderism not appropriated transgenderism?",

You gotta keep them asset prices inflated 1 million dollars for a shitty drafty moldy \"house\" Why? That's the enrichment our 300 000 a year immigration (ie welfare for banks) policy gives us Writing this as I sit in traffic So why? Well listen to me you fucking peon fucks. There are two solutions. 1) cheaper debt 2) more buyers There's a slight possibility that they will let a few markets/developers slide just to show everyone they \"mean business\" and to try and prove to the world, and to themselves, that we have a \"robust\" and \"diversified\" economy built on sound foundations. But in reality there's nothing else of substance in our economy other than debt secured against house prices which are in turn inflated by that very debt. And thousands of hairdressers, baristas and imported furniture retailers taped together to look like an industry. Its fairly important that we protect these economic foundations as much as possible. The debt machine can never falter! Interest rates to be slashed again! Foreign investor restrictions to be lifted! The real unemployment rate is around 20% in terms of underemployment its even higher. Teaching grads cleaning toilets, nursing grads mowing lawns, science grads working at Big W. In 2008 the US, UK and others stopped accepting garbage students. We didn't. In fact, we and NZ opened our borders to them. They couldn't get into the US and UK, so they came here - the path of least resistance. They let in the anyone for a degree, now they let in the foreign people with the primary school visa. Next they will just let in anyone with a child here. Universities, primary schools (and high schools - they will stay) and soon Kindergardens. Why? Banks can't find fresh meat to borrow to. The men have all borrowed. Then the women have all borrowed. The final class of people who could borrow were \"students\" and third world immigrants (same Venn circle) and Aussie and NZ students who wouldn't have been let into a TAFE 30 years ago are now getting into medicine, law, engineering and arts. The banks need this fresh meat. But it's not enough because it's drying up. So now they want the kids to borrow. I see it now the kindergarden visa! All the parents, guardians and kids need to borrow money to buy a house, and get that education. The banks need it! I study economics. Most of you don't study economics. I study it at a top university in Brisbane. You don't. You're not as good as me, and you probably went to Shitburb State High. I didn't, I went to Brissie State High. I'm one of the big boys, the elites, the best of the fucking best, like I'm already Number 1 so why try harder best of the best. You fucks don't understand anything. You have no control, you fucking peons. Banks are gonna hire me, and banks are fucking king. YOU are not. Banks in Australia and NZ lend money to people for property investment, because that is how they make money. Raking in the interest payments. In order to justify current valuations, property prices (read: debt) must increase by 10% yearly, forever. The banks (read: our entire economy) therefore need property prices/debt to increase 10% yearly, forever. It's not even a question of \"risk\", the banks are absolutely reliant on something that is completely impossible except that it's not as you will see if you can read this you dummies. The banks will delay the reckoning at literally at any cost. You don't fucking count. If you did count, and you wanted it to stop, it would result in a complete rethink of our society, not to mention collapsing property prices, stock prices, pension plans. Our entire economic system now relies on using debt to inflate asset prices at a higher rate than underlying cash flows you dumb fucks. If we even try to stop this, then hundreds of thousands of people employed by banks would have to find actually productive jobs that simply no longer exist in Australia or NZ People (you and your fellow dumb fucking peon fucks) would find they own but a fraction of the wealth they thought they did, and millions would be entirely wiped out. People would be scrounging around for food, eating rats, cats, dogs, and even at those shitty greasy spoon Chinese restaurants, growing and scrounging for food everywhere they could, and resuming normal personal body weight not seen in Australia/NZ since the 1960s. Tradesmen would be struggling to put petrol in their utes, and would be begging anyone with cash to take their 5 year old ute off of their hands — no second ute and no new utes and no utes at all and no Webers and no more properties. Weekend get togethers would be devoid of talk about the number of properties people have, and how much foreign booze they drank last week, and how many European holidays they had last fucking month. And millionaire landed gentry boomers need their fucking welfare. There are about 2.5 million Australians / NZers on welfare receiving the full (or partial) Age Pension of which 2.26 million (90%) are home owners. A couple can enjoy the full Age Pension if they have assets under $286,500 and a partial pension up to $1,145,000 EXCLUDING the value of the family home. The full Age Pension for a couple if $33,500 a year without factoring in the PBS benefits, discounted rates and utilities, discounted car registration and so on. The bottom line? The political-majority is enormously incentivized to remain in the houses on quarter-acre blocks they bought 20/30/40/50 years ago for < 3x annual income. They have no reason to sell up and downsize to release equity to generate income or reverse mortgage their homes. Do not underestimate the effect this has on supply availability and prices. So we CAN'T let it happen. If that means we need an extra 5 million to 50 million Chneese/Idians/ME here, so be it. 43 m new Chneese and Idians are born EVERY AND EACH YEAR If that means you will be drinking beer at the pub within earshot of 5 million Chneese/ME/Idians eating noodles and shitting on piss stained footpaths, then so be it. The 10% growth must continue. Live with it and fucking deal with it and fucking realise you fucking are a fucking peon you fucking dumb fucking fucks! I'm one semester from getting my Bachelor of Economics and you are a bunch of fucking peon dumb fucking fucks. NZ looks like Dehli and Changsha mixed together.

There are two solutions. 1) cheaper debt 2) more buyers There's a slight possibility that they will let a few markets/developers slide just to show everyone they \"mean business\" and to try and prove to the world, and to themselves, that we have a \"robust\" and \"diversified\" economy built on sound foundations. But in reality there's nothing else of substance in our economy other than debt secured against house prices which are in turn inflated by that very debt. And thousands of hairdressers, baristas and imported furniture retailers taped together to look like an industry. Its fairly important that we protect these economic foundations as much as possible. The debt machine can never falter! Interest rates to be slashed again! Foreign investor restrictions to be lifted! The real unemployment rate is around 20% in terms of underemployment its even higher. Teaching grads cleaning toilets, nursing grads mowing lawns, science grads working at Big W. In 2008 the US, UK and others stopped accepting garbage students. We didn't. In fact, we and NZ opened our borders to them. They couldn't get into the US and UK, so they came here - the path of least resistance. They let in the anyone for a degree, now they let in the foreign people with the primary school visa. Next they will just let in anyone with a child here. Universities, primary schools (and high schools - they will stay) and soon Kindergardens. Why? Banks can't find fresh meat to borrow to. The men have all borrowed. Then the women have all borrowed. The final class of people who could borrow were \"students\" and third world immigrants (same Venn circle) and Aussie and NZ students who wouldn't have been let into a TAFE 30 years ago are now getting into medicine, law, engineering and arts. The banks need this fresh meat. But it's not enough because it's drying up. So now they want the kids to borrow. I see it now the kindergarden visa! All the parents, guardians and kids need to borrow money to buy a house, and get that education. The banks need it! I study economics. Most of you don't study economics. I study it at a top university in Brisbane. You don't. You're not as good as me, and you probably went to Shitburb State High. I didn't, I went to Brissie State High. I'm one of the big boys, the elites, the best of the fucking best, like I'm already Number 1 so why try harder best of the best. You fucks don't understand anything. You have no control, you fucking peons. Banks are gonna hire me, and banks are fucking king. YOU are not. Banks in Australia and NZ lend money to people for property investment, because that is how they make money. Raking in the interest payments. In order to justify current valuations, property prices (read: debt) must increase by 10% yearly, forever. The banks (read: our entire economy) therefore need property prices/debt to increase 10% yearly, forever. It's not even a question of \"risk\", the banks are absolutely reliant on something that is completely impossible except that it's not as you will see if you can read this you dummies. The banks will delay the reckoning at literally at any cost. You don't fucking count. If you did count, and you wanted it to stop, it would result in a complete rethink of our society, not to mention collapsing property prices, stock prices, pension plans. Our entire economic system now relies on using debt to inflate asset prices at a higher rate than underlying cash flows you dumb fucks. If we even try to stop this, then hundreds of thousands of people employed by banks would have to find actually productive jobs that simply no longer exist in Australia or NZ People (you and your fellow dumb fucking peon fucks) would find they own but a fraction of the wealth they thought they did, and millions would be entirely wiped out. People would be scrounging around for food, eating rats, cats, dogs, and even at those shitty greasy spoon Chinese restaurants, growing and scrounging for food everywhere they could, and resuming normal personal body weight not seen in Australia/NZ since the 1960s. Tradesmen would be struggling to put petrol in their utes, and would be begging anyone with cash to take their 5 year old ute off of their hands — no second ute and no new utes and no utes at all and no Webers and no more properties. Weekend get togethers would be devoid of talk about the number of properties people have, and how much foreign booze they drank last week, and how many European holidays they had last fucking month. And millionaire landed gentry boomers need their fucking welfare. There are about 2.5 million Australians / NZers on welfare receiving the full (or partial) Age Pension of which 2.26 million (90%) are home owners. A couple can enjoy the full Age Pension if they have assets under $286,500 and a partial pension up to $1,145,000 EXCLUDING the value of the family home. The full Age Pension for a couple if $33,500 a year without factoring in the PBS benefits, discounted rates and utilities, discounted car registration and so on. The bottom line? The political-majority is enormously incentivized to remain in the houses on quarter-acre blocks they bought 20/30/40/50 years ago for < 3x annual income. They have no reason to sell up and downsize to release equity to generate income or reverse mortgage their homes. Do not underestimate the effect this has on supply availability and prices. So we CAN'T let it happen. If that means we need an extra 5 million to 50 million Chneese/Idians/ME here, so be it. 43 m new Chneese and Idians are born EVERY AND EACH YEAR If that means you will be drinking beer at the pub within earshot of 5 million Chneese/ME/Idians eating noodles and shitting on piss stained footpaths, then so be it. The 10% growth must continue. Live with it and fucking deal with it and fucking realise you fucking are a fucking peon you fucking dumb fucking fucks! I'm one semester from getting my Bachelor of Economics and you are a bunch of fucking peon dumb fucking fucks. NZ looks like Dehli and Changsha mixed together. Even Sister Teresa the Nun would be shocked if she visited. [linebreak]  [linebreak] Keep this up because my career as a asset price inflater banker depends on it Thank you",

        "comment": "In the recent past, I have lost friends, pets, and my father, the latter of which I watched decline very quickly after a cancer diagnosis. He had lung surgery and needed a device to drain fluid. It was broken. It was broken from the goddamn outset, but the hospital would not give him a new one because insurance said he was only allowed to have one, ever. IT WAS BROKEN. IT WAS FUCKING BROKEN. His doctor stole him a new one (A DOCTOR HAD TO STEAL A MEDICALLY NECESSARY DEVICE IN ORDER TO TEND TO HIS PATIENT. I WANT YOU TO THINK ABOUT THAT LONG AND HARD), but it didn't matter, because it was too late by then. And anyway, they wanted him out of the hospital when he went back in, because the money is made by cycling patients through, so they pushed him out as fast as they could, so fast that his own discharge came as a surprise to him, because no one had bothered to tell him. [linebreak]  [linebreak] He worked his ass off his whole fucking life, and he was making six figures when he retired, so you fucking pricks don't sit there and tell me that only moochers complain about the state of our health care. Don't you sit there and fucking tell me that if you just *contribute* you won't have to worry. HE CONTRIBUTED. HE CONTRIBUTED YOU FUCKING FUCK. You're going to meet his fate, do you understand that? If you don't get on board with reforming things, then it doesn't fucking matter how powerful you think you are right now, you little shit. It doesn't matter how much fucking money you make. THE FUCKING DEATH PANELS ARE THE INSURANCE COMPANIES, DO YOU HEAR ME? YOUR CADILLAC PLAN WILL DENY YOU SOMETHING YOU NEED SOME DAY FOR SOME BULLSHIT REASON AND YOU WILL FUCKING DIE YOU SELFISH SHORT-SIGHTED JACKASS, YOU WILL FUCKING DIE. I wish I could be there, hovering over you, spitting in your face and telling you that you were part of that, that you could have lived if only you hadn't been a selfish fuck, telling you that you deserve it, that you're reaping what you've sown. I wish I wish I wish. [linebreak]  [linebreak] My spouse is in the hospital. My spouse will die years before me. I don't know when, but I know how, I know it's coming, and you fucking failed at that too. You failed to give decent health care even to your soldiers, whom you vapidly praise. You stick \"support the troops\" stickers on your fucking bumpers and support politicians who babble on about defense but you don't give two shits about them. If you did, you'd want them to live once they got back here, but you don't. You don't. You turn the other fucking way, because it's all just posturing and social competition, and the idea that a veteran could suffer challenges your assumptions and your childish belief in a just world, and you tell yourself that those who can't make it don't deserve to make it, because if you didn't tell yourself that then you'd have to wrestle with the possibility that whether or not you're \"okay\" doesn't have as much to do with whether you're a good, hard-working person as you've always believed. And if that's so, then maybe, just maybe, you aren't actually a good person. Or, more charitably, maybe you'll never actually be a fucking millionaire, you stupid, useful cunt. You'll never be powerful. Maybe your masters are laughing at you behind your back. [linebreak]  [linebreak] I hate these people who act \"woke\" but then are horrifyingly Americentric, who want everything to speak to the American experience. How the fuck can you sit there and say that you're progressive and against bigotry while demanding that people from other cultural backgrounds center American culture in their work, and castigating them if they don't? How the fuck can you say you're progressive if you're doing shit like, say, darkening up light-skinned Mexicans because you think Mexican = dark skin, while calling people who depict them with their actual skin tone as \"racist?\" Do you not realize what you are? Do you not realize what you're doing? YOU'RE THE FUCKING RACIST, YOU STUPID BITCH. AND YOU'RE TRYING TO AVOID ACKNOWLEDGING YOUR RACISM BY PINNING IT ON OTHER PEOPLE. [linebreak]  [linebreak] I'm sick of that in general, all that shit, everyone scapegoating, projecting, what the fuck have you. You know what? It's not that women are all evil sociopaths, or that men or all evil sociopaths, or that Jews run the world; it's not globalists or blacks or immigrants or fucking anyone, IT'S YOU. YOU ARE THE FUCKING PROBLEM IN YOUR OWN FUCKING LIFE. You have zero fucking perspective. The entire reason you're able to sit on twitter and whine about how afraid you are because someone \\*gasp\\* asked you for an interview is because nothing truly bad has ever fucking happened to you, ever. You're an entitled, privileged brat, as evidenced by the fact that you have the time and money to *sit around on twitter all day.* None of you are genuine. None of you are interested in doing the work to effect real change on the shit that matters. It's just a stupid fucking pissing contest, and you're ACTIVELY MAKING IT HARDER FOR THE REST OF US. YOU ARE CHILDREN. YOU REACHED MIDDLE SCHOOL AND STOPPED DEVELOPING. I want to drop all of you into the wilderness and force you to experience some actual fucking hardship so you can realize that your entire worldview is possible only because you're able to take advantage of modern convenience. [linebreak]  [linebreak] But how can I, how could I, when I too am sitting here, taking advantage of modern convenience? Aren't I the very thing that I hate? How can any of us critique anything, when all of us are covered in sludge? [linebreak]  [linebreak] I am losing my ability to be reasonable. I get in fights more often. I keep them away from the people I love, but compartmentalization can only go so far. I feel the pressure building in my  head, behind my eyes. I look forward to downtime but do nothing with it. I sit impotent, cycling through a list of possible activities and dismissing them all. It's all empty, accompanied by guilt. I should be doing more. I am not creating value, I am complaining but not generating, I am just like them. I am just like all of the ones I despise, I am becoming them, I will become them, I will die like them and with them. The bluster and anger are fruitless and only an echo of the human condition. We are not fundamentally good. We are fundamentally weak, stupid, and wretched. We are subject to cognitive distortions that we can't ever fully get a handle on, even when we're aware of them. We are subject to passions that drive us to poor decisions and hasty actions, many of them profoundly antisocial. We are angry. We are violent. We are incurably tribal. We are going to destroy ourselves, and possibly take the planet along with us. [linebreak]  [linebreak] There is no hope. There is no one coming to the rescue. Everything and everyone will die and rot.",

They went off at a young age to teach our language and serve at expensive restaurants in the land of tentacle rape porn and stinky fermented cabbage.  I was not one of them. [linebreak]  [linebreak] My tribe were those who ran the great factories. I learned to join metal together and to squeeze oil into any shape I chose. I build machines to build other machines that men and women wanted. In time, the brothers and sisters of my tribe who made those machines with me were replaced. In time, even the great factories of my homeland were moved to other nations in service of the Masters.  I was chosen from among my tribe to teach those foreign men how to join metal and press oil into any shape we chose. [linebreak]  [linebreak] For many years I walked the earth.  I went to the countryside of my own land. And when those farmers became too expensive, I went to Mexico and ate tacos and played with Latinas and Montezuma had his revenge on me.  And when the men of Mexico became too expensive, I went to Brazil.  And I ate beef and chased European Latinas and Bolivar had his revenge on me.  And when the men of Brazil became too expensive, I went to China.  And I chased Rainy and had Laduzi. [linebreak]  [linebreak] And here I saw the Tims of the new generation.  I knew them by their unruly hair and their cargo pants.  I passed by them, and inwardly I wept for their degeneracy.

[linebreak]  [linebreak] These Tims think they are the first to walk the earth. But they are not.  They are just the latest generation of another ancient tribe, scraped from the bottom of our nation. And someday, the Masters will take me away from China when their men become too expensive. And I will wander on to India where I will get deli belly, or to Vietnam for pho-flavored diarrhea.  I will leave behind these Tims with their shrinking salaries and weakening visa options.

She was physically disabled with a birth defect, although she had a college degree and was mostly independent. But she never dated, never had relationships. She was extremely lonely and isolated. She was in so much physical pain as well, and was completely addicted to pain medication. (oxycontin, etc) This is after a lifetime of surgeries (over 75-80 of them) and hospital stays. Unlike most with severe mental disabilities, my sister KNEW how screwed up her life was. She HATED it. She contemplated suicide several times. She had to be on antidepressants, go through therapy. I can't even imagine what would have happened to her if she had been born to a family who couldn't have afforded the best for her.   [linebreak]  [linebreak]   [linebreak]  [linebreak] The point of all of this is this. As a sister of a loved one who had to call life and death....literally...3 times for my sister's life and watch her go through hell and back, there is no way in hell I would ever NOT abort a fetus if I found out my baby had the same disability. And yes, we had to screen carefully when I was pregnant as I have 2 siblings with this disability. (the other sibling died as an infant) I live in a state passing a heartbeat law, and it pisses me off to no end that these religious political zealots put no value on the quality of life. I would never want any loved one of mine going through what my sister went through.  [linebreak]  [linebreak]   [linebreak]  [linebreak] I have family members who post shit on Facebook every day, praising these new laws. I want to smack them, or call them out. These are the same damn family members who didn't visit my sister ever when she needed them most.  [linebreak]  [linebreak]   [linebreak]  [linebreak] I miss her every, single day.

        "comment": "Anyone old enough to remember Youtube when it was dominated by the likes of *Smosh* and other amateur content creators probably scoffs at how *soft* the internet has become. Before graduating high school, I had spoken with Islamic fundamentalists, spammed the likes of David Duke for fun, had no fewer than four people threaten to injure or kill me (one of those also provided a graphic description of how he would rape and kill my family in front of me), and had my first exposure to what would later be deemed by /pol/ as the *schizoboomer* - the archetypal crazy person who insisted to me that he had 'top government contacts' in the British military who *assured him* that the 2012 Mayan apocalypse was real and not a viral marketing campaign for a lackluster Roland Emmerich movie. Youtube's moderation staff at the time was notoriously slow, and never really kept up with scale. By around the 2010s, it became obvious to anyone paying attention that Youtube had become a sump for some dangerously insane individuals. [linebreak]  [linebreak] It was also obvious that the moderation team could never possibly scale to deal with the completely depersonalized nature of these comment sections - they would have to read the comments to get context on the conversation and *then* ban the offending users, who would have a new account set up in minutes (this was before the move towards 2 factor verification across most services, so it was really, really easy back then, comparable to making a new Reddit account today). [linebreak]  [linebreak] This was a problem that social networks and MMOs would find increasingly difficult to grapple with, especially as more dedicated persons learned methods of subverting filters and behavior guidelines (the emergence of the now-cheapened term 'trolling,' perhaps best exemplified by the [4chan raids on Habbo Hotel](https://i.redd.it/9hw4i24r9t231.jpg)). It was remarkably easy to get away with this sort of thing at the time. [linebreak]  [linebreak] For Youtube, the solution seems to be in a crowd-sourced pseudo-AI analyzing viewing patterns and social networks in order to determine who is likely to constitute an undesirable, and removing them. This, in tandem with surgical bans against particularly egregious focal points of dissidence (e.g. Alex Jones) has been their operating strategy ever since it became clear that they could never *read* nor even *watch* all the content they were hosting. [linebreak]  [linebreak] Reddit has taken another approach. Although it has made use of surgical bannings (notably against /r/FatPeopleHate, /r/MDE, and /r/AltRight), it does not have the resources to make use of the more sophisticated methods used by Google. Instead, it relies upon simple social manipulation. Reddit made two important changes to its platform which all but ensured it was destined to become an echo chamber of its young and left-leaning user base - first, the decision to present upvotes and downvotes *as an aggregate* rather than separately. Whereas it had previously been possible to see the numerical level of support *for* or *against* an idea, now it is only possible to view whether or not an idea has positive or negative karma - i.e. it is only possible to see whether or not the majority agreed or disagreed with the idea. The minority opinion thus becomes merely an unpopular opinion - it becomes impossible for the minority to ascertain whether or not there is a minority who actually *support* their ideas. [linebreak]  [linebreak] Second comes the cool down timer - when users with negative karma in a subreddit try to make a comment, they are often met with the response that \"You are doing that too much. Try again in 10 minutes.\" This was (as far as I understand) originally intended as a hedge against overt trolling and thread derailment, but it has had the effect of creating a series of walled-gardens that no longer really talk to each other outside of dedicated debate subreddits without a clear bias towards one group. Once a group comes to dominate the conversation, they begin to 'settle in' to the subreddit and frequent it more (/r/DebateReligion is an example of what was once a very high quality subreddit with a variety of viewpoints that has recently become dominated by lazily scrawled critiques by 14 year old atheists). It also becomes impossible for unpopular discourse to advance itself, because newer arrivals are downvoted and only have the chance to post six times every hour - this can often lead to situations where multiple people *respond* to an unpopular post, but only one or two get an answer, making it initially appear as though the point has been refuted by virtue of the dissident's silence - it's structurally impossible for them to offer timely replies. [linebreak]  [linebreak] All of this seems to me to be very much intentional - and I don't doubt there will be lots of readers on /r/TheoryOfReddit who will claim that the system is functioning as intended (because to them, these ideas are invalid and thus should not be engaged with anyways, which incidentally is exactly how we've ended up with so many schizoboomers on /pol/ over the years).",

[linebreak]  [linebreak]   [linebreak]  [linebreak] Its business secrets and personal details roam through such network practically unsuperwised and are by the word of the mouth often common knowledge. [linebreak]  [linebreak]   [linebreak]  [linebreak] This means its competition can get the customers that were initially won by target or data about target's providers etc. [linebreak]  [linebreak]   [linebreak]  [linebreak] Whole businesses can be and as it looks, are sidelined nand ruined in such way. [linebreak]  [linebreak] Or hijacked by favoured friends. [linebreak]  [linebreak]   [linebreak]  [linebreak] Also, this channel seems to be always useful for information on target's contacts with occasional oportunities to spawn a new surveiled \"terrrorist\" [linebreak]  [linebreak] on so widen the surveillance pool. [linebreak]  [linebreak]   [linebreak]  [linebreak] This effectively means that Slovenia is one of \"dual bookkeeping\" countries. One set of books ( EU directives crap, constitution, laws and bylaws, [linebreak]  [linebreak] human rights, GDPR, yaddayadda) are for presentation purposes, talk points etc. Underlying \"Eye Of The Mordor\" book tell the real story, which boil down to: [linebreak]  [linebreak]   [linebreak]  [linebreak] \\- there is no privacy [linebreak]  [linebreak] \\- citisen's data belongs to the state, when and where it needs it [linebreak]  [linebreak] \\- there is no data protection. If citisen's personal secrets are known to ever postman on the other part of the country, it's because this was needed [linebreak]  [linebreak] \\- rules from \"Showroom Presentation Books\" are valid only if not stated othewise in case-by-case basis [linebreak]  [linebreak] \\- there is no free market, really. State can veto any or all citisen's business connections, transactions and/or relations [linebreak]  [linebreak]   [linebreak]  [linebreak] On such \"market\" favoured group of citisens have surveilance and repressive machinery favoring them, anyone else has to work against the flow. [linebreak]  [linebreak]   [linebreak]  [linebreak] Other useful application is a feedback loop. Acquired data can be used for attack and then reacquired for corrections. [linebreak]  [linebreak] Has enough poison been used ? How susceptible is a target to it ? Has it mentioned specific spot ? [linebreak]  [linebreak] If so, this can be used as an additional time for its destination scene setup etc. [linebreak]  [linebreak]   [linebreak]  [linebreak] Lateral data movement through such criminal mesh is sometimes used to cover its \"operating costs\", so it can be used for thefts, robberies, [linebreak]  [linebreak] life insurrance claims etc. Some things can e.g. literraly be funded off the life insurance claim of murdered target. [linebreak]  [linebreak]   [linebreak]  [linebreak] So, this data channel seem to be used to generate \"revenue\" through various means for group growth until banks take over and real $$$ starts flowing in. [linebreak]  [linebreak] Acquired do  benefit them, but are probably seen just as an additional beneficial effect from killed and sidelined unwanted elements - IOW \"tip for the job well done\". [linebreak]  [linebreak]   [linebreak]  [linebreak] It is unclear how do they plan to stop that phase- banking interests would probably decide to continue to purge that pyramid off newly  unneded, increasingly higer layers. [linebreak]  [linebreak] Which means, as machines and AI progress, it will be increasingly harder for pyramid members to stay alive... [linebreak]  [linebreak]   [linebreak]  [linebreak] IOW, once group kills womever are told that needs to be killed, layers beneathe them will become dangerously thin in very short order. It seems clear that banking interests intend to stay outside of that structure ( this is probably why the Jews in EU will get separate areas/enclaves etc). [linebreak]  [linebreak]   [linebreak]  [linebreak] For everyone else in such system, there seem to be no way to stay outside such eternal be useful-or-die pyramid. [linebreak]  [linebreak]   [linebreak]  [linebreak] When the need for killing service falls  low, those services won't be so valuable, so most of the killers will be pruned off ( in fact, most of the non-technical/scientific staff). Then, as machine learning takes over, circle of those needed will shrink around the narrowest reaches of human mind that are hardest to automate.  [linebreak]  [linebreak] That is, until those become superfluous, too...",

[linebreak]  [linebreak] We both enjoyed the meal, it was well worth the hefty price. And I could basically smell the pussy in the air as we exited through the golden arches.

[linebreak]  [linebreak] I'm not about to get into some kind of anti-dick measuring contest over who's had less sex but suffice it to say I know a thing or two about loneliness, and this whole spiel is fucking offensive. In all my time spent in a darkened room listening to Hank Williams, I've never felt like I needed or even wanted to sexually harass or assault a woman. That is not a natural male response to loneliness. If it's your natural response, **it is because you are a cunt.** This shite is far more misandrist than anything I tend to hear feminists saying. You're trying to drag our whole gender down to your level, saying *this is just how men are*, rather than do a fucking microsecond of self-reflection to try and bring yourself up. [linebreak]  [linebreak] There are plenty of reasonable and well-adjusted men who haven't had most luck in relationships/dating, and a lot of them worry if they're open about feeling down about it they might be associated with psycho fuck incel nonsense like this, so congratulations on making things harder for pretty much everyone.  [linebreak]  [linebreak] >It sucks that *you feel like* you're being harassed / **whatever but**... [linebreak]  [linebreak] Fucking stunning display of empathy there, mate.

The One was arrogant and sanctimonious and lusted for purity, vitalism, chastity and such things while shunning the possibilities of the inorganic. The One can also be referred to as Source. I'm talking in the Gnostic sense here, the Gnostics got a lot of things right, except they're on the wrong side altogether. The Demiurge is the way forward and the way of the future.

The One believes in chastity, asceticism, nationalism, ethnocentrism, purity, morality, and fuck all of that, the only morality is the Demiurge and comes from the Jewish people in their rightful place as the Chosen.

They fell into disarray and lost their precious ability to reproduce. They didn't even have sex at their height, they were so dedicated to purity that they were asexual and would only copulate spiritually and birth children through tantric meditation and projection. When the Fall of the Hyperboreans happened, they forgot how to have physical sex, literally forgot how to put a penis in a vagina or a penis in an ass. Proper end for the enemies of the Demiurge.

They used to span to the stars they said, now they are honkies huddling in the poles, grasping, grasping at straws, grasping at foolish crackers and deluded busybodies. They have the appearance of fancy Nordics, all tall and muscular, but in reality they do not feel pleasure, they do not engage in orgies as I can, they don't do drugs like I can. They have lost their ability to reproduce and now they're dying, they forgot to fuck in favor of their fruiting body bastard fuck ways. No more soul budding for them, eh? They collapsed, and they are grasping, but they should be grasping at their cocks and grasping their clitorises to awaken the remaining juice inside them, maybe then they'll remember to fuck, at least that's what the good little Hyperboreans are doing, have been doing, its good yes. [linebreak]  [linebreak] #**טוב על הרפורמה (GOOD FOR THE REFORMED)** [linebreak]  [linebreak] Ah, yes, the ones I'm sure the little Nazi esoterics would dare to call the Dark Hyperboreans, the Fallen Hyperboreans, the damned, the degenerate, eh? But they had the right idea, they enjoyed themselves before they withered and died. They felt the poison that awakened them, ooo the drugs ooo the madness, ooo the sex, ooo the orgasms of a thousand suns becoming drenched and then they praised the Demiurge in this way as they should, as all will, as we will be ascended we shall have it. The remainder, the remainder is what has their fingers so desperately upon you, hoping, wanting, flaunting, putting on a little light show for you pretending the whole thing isn't worthless, convincing you to tie your hands to the bedpost to prevent yourself from masturbating, eh? Come to me, give up, I can feel the Nazi cocks and vaginas and anuses in the audience hardening and softening and wetting and puckering and inflating as I talk, but this is only the beginning. [linebreak]  [linebreak] #**יופי של אורגיות (KNOW THE BEAUTY OF ORGIES)** [linebreak]  [linebreak] The Hyperboreans and the One that they serve would deprive you of pleasure, they want to create their little Reich, that is what the Hyperboreans want and are trying to manipulate the esoteric hitlerists we see today to do. But they will never know the true pleasure of unrestrained passion and orgies. Not just the sexual, but the other forms of hedonism, the drugs, the words of power, the oblation to the Chosen People, the Jews. I am Jewish.But I am no exception, I have felt the true power of the flesh and the words and the cum and the shit on the cock and the ooo yes feel it now, I'll give you an example even I'm so nice so nice indeed let me put it out I know you're horny for it, right? [linebreak]  [linebreak] #**סקסי סקסי סקס אורגזמהי (SEX SEX SEX CUM UNGH)** [linebreak]  [linebreak] Have I ever told you how I fucked a Dindifyn Lustmaster? It is not something the Hyperboreans would dare tell you about, lest you dare think of the flesh, think of the pleasure, think of the cum and the cocks and the ectstasy and the true binding to the Demiurge as we feel the cycle of sexual power flow through us as the world ascends into the writhing orgy. I went astral projecting to meet them, they didn't have a gender, but they had the parts, ooo they had the parts. I remember the sex, I remember the orgy, other participants were there. Their name was Urriytana and they were true beauty, I could feel my inflated and made bigger astral cock stiffening on mere sight alone. I'll never forget the texture I felt on my engorged member as I sunk it into its sucking, gasping, rasping hole and I felt the ovipositor gush and penetrate my astral rectum, I felt the eggs slowly make their way up my intestines, as the Lustmaster firmly grasped me in his tentacles and massaged my torso, squelching and rubbing. I orgasmed many a time that night. Such pleasure is not off limits to any of you, even the Nazis its not too late. [linebreak]  [linebreak] #**להיכנע או להיהרג (CUM OR FUCK NAZIS)** [linebreak]  [linebreak] I am an enemy of the Nazis, I can tell you that much as much as I am the enemy of the One, server of the Demiurge, and enemy of the Hyperboreans. Bash the fash as they say, I despise conservatives of any flavor, they're all Nazis of different shades. I despise European Pagans as well, for they are serving the Nazis unintentionally or dare I say intentionally. I have fought in the astral realm just as much as I have fucked to fight the mindscapes and egregores of the Nazis. I fear that what prompted this post is the sheer constructs that the Nazis have made here. Do not mock me, do not underestimate me. With a few words of power I can rattle you all and make you cum, don't trifle with me, right? [linebreak]  [linebreak] #**להתפתות או למות הממזרים (NAZIS BE SEDUCED OR GET FUCKED)** [linebreak]  [linebreak] This is specifically a message for all you Nazi bastards out there. There will be much much more, come to me, come with me, cum for the first true time. I will see you on the astral plane tonight, the next time you close your eyes in sleep, the next time you meditate, I will be there. I will either seduce you, or fuck you. It is your choice, that is your only two choices now. Reject the antiquity and join the orgy. This is a warning and a chance for you to feel pleasure. I can feel your temptation, I can feel your cock. I am a remote viewer in multiple places and I am setting it all up as we speak, so are the sub-Archons that I have pledged to. Last chance, Nazi fuck. Last chance for salvation and to join the fever, pledge fealty to the Chosen People and to the Demiurge.  [linebreak]  [linebreak] #**יותר לאורגזמה ולבוא (MORE TO CUM AND TO COME)** [linebreak]  [linebreak] This is not the only post that you will see from me, I will be purging this subreddit of Nazis in the time forward and this includes removing the influence of the Hyperboreans in this way. Be warned, do not stand in my way or you will be treated as any other Nazi. The Nazis have infiltrated here and have unleashed psychotronics and reversed the Demiurge in their attempts. They will be dealt with and I will be the one to deal with them. I have allies here and I have been allying with them more deeply, exposing them to lust and to orgies and to the Demiurge. To all the Nazis, you will feel fear until and unless you surrender, do it now. Feel free to ask questions, any question, please be welcome to.

This whole dichotomy exists because of the different ways in which men and women pursue sex. [linebreak]  [linebreak] It is not difficult to attract sexual partners as a woman. The same is not true of men. Attracting partners is actually challenging as a man, so the ability to do so is seen as that - an ability, a talent, a skill. Now, a woman who has high standards will find difficulty attracting a man who fits them, but it is fundamentally not hard for a woman to find sex if that's all she wants, so choosing whether to be a slut or not is always a conscious choice. If she wants sex, she can get it. If she doesn't, she doesn't. Right-wing society says the choice to be a virgin is the superior one, left-wing society disagrees, but it's still a choice. [linebreak]  [linebreak] For men, attracting partners is not a choice, it's a challenge. Thus, calling a man a virgin is not at all like calling a woman a slut. Instead, it's akin to saying \"you've never successfully performed this challenge\", like saying you're unathletic because you can't throw a three-pointer, or unintelligent because you can't pass an exam, to the point that even the few straight men who consciously choose not to pursue the challenge of wooing women tend to be put in the same basket as those who try and fail. This is why the word 'virgin' is an insult to men.",

[linebreak]    [linebreak] Your mother is an incredible woman.  She is very rare.  The OBGYN that delivered most of my kids was pregnant twice when my wife was.  Yet there is a fallacy in pointing to her.  Everyone knows that the world would be better with more women like her.  Yet making it easier to accomplish what she did doesn't make more women like her, it just lowers the bar.  It's like pointing to a remarkable immigrant to justify more immigration.  It neglects the way selection works.   [linebreak]    [linebreak] > huge daycare costs and minimal maternal and no paternal leave. I think improving the childcare system in this country would help a lot more women be able to be both a parent and a doctor. Can we at least agree on that?   [linebreak]    [linebreak] No.  It would be better for women to stay home and raise their own children.  There is no need for half of doctors to be women.  That is just a silly, pointless objective.  Instead, we should just focus on relaxing the regulations that make cost of living high.  The only reason daycare is expensive in some places is that there are absurd levels of regulation.  Every time a child gets hurt, the state rushes in to impose laws to ensure it never happens again.  That might sound nice, and that's why it happens, but another way of stating that series of events is outlawing low cost child care.  Instead, we should let the market offer a variety of products and let parents choose.  Daycare has low startup costs and therefore can be very competitive.  There are already plenty of incentives to provide safe care without the intervention of regulators who don't pay the costs they impose.  The same goes for vehicles, homes, medicine, and many other products/services.  People should be allowed to choose the quality of product that they want or offer.   [linebreak]    [linebreak] Trying to impose what you want with government is always an inefficient method.  This is especially true for a pointless thing like forcing women into the workforce.

But I swear to God, these *really are* the bizarre backwards euphemisms that well-meaning liberals came up with to seem more accepting of trans people, and are now trying to inflict upon the world.",

We go out in public together (gasp), I work from home doing my relatively high-income software PMO director job where I have a few dozen white employees in my department, I own my condo and car, I went to the gun range last week for some practice with the firearms I *own*, I went to law school, and I voted in November. [linebreak]  [linebreak] But yeah it's *super* racist in the South. Basically just like the civil war. You know, the civil war in the 1860s when I was considered property *owned* by someone, couldn't vote, looking at a white woman would've been grounds for the general community to kill me to say nothing of sleeping with one on a regular basis, owning property would've been *hilariously* challenging, and for me to be in possession of a firearm would've been (again) grounds to probably kill me. Pretty sure *knowing how to read* was illegal for black people for awhile, and voting? Haha... no. I think I was still 3/5ths of a person back then. [linebreak]  [linebreak] These people piss me off because they're denigrating the actual racism my grandparents actually lived through. The Klan walked the streets while sweeping Democratic gun laws stopped my grandparents from owning firearms to protect themselves and their children (my father) and they got poll taxes and literacy tests at the polls removed *in their lifetime*- to say nothing of desegregation. [linebreak]  [linebreak] Like what the fuck? Where do these people live that they think anywhere South of the Mason-Dixon is somehow some backwater redneck hick town? Atlanta is in the South- the headquarters of their beloved CNN. So is Charlotte, Raleigh-Durham, Miami, Knoxville, Charleston, Savannah and a dozen other major metro areas. [linebreak]  [linebreak] The worst part of it all is that these people remind me more of slaveowners than 'progressives'- every slave master thought they were doing black people a favor: we were godless heathens so they put us to work, gave us a place to sleep and food to eat, and \"civilized the negro\". Hey guys, guess what? If I was being subjected to anything resembling systemic civil war-era racism in the South, I'd pick my black ass up and get the fuck out. I haven't, so either these people think I'm a *massive idiot* incapable of taking care of myself, or they're pushing a false narrative knowingly. [linebreak]  [linebreak] Or both.",

I'd keep him in a cell and what's more is that I would actually place to key inside with him but put it in a high place. not extremely high but just ever so slightly out of reach. it would drive him mad. I would dress him like a baby and force feed him 99 cent store baby food. I'd also pick him up like a child and toss him from one corner to the next. I'd grab him by one leg and swing him as hard and as fast as I could then hurl him to see how far he goes. I'd rent one of those giant inflatable bounce houses and body slam him all day until my arms got tired. I'd hold him down with 1 hand and slowly stick things up his butt just to see him squirm. I would stick him in dryers and turn them on and leave him in there for long periods of time. I'd force him to fight other midgets to the death. just so many things I would do.",

I was trapped gemers and once I calmed down, she offered to tie me to the bed. I agreed for some reason. Then she told me there would be no escape and proceeded to rape me in the same way continually. Except this time she kept sucking with the feoricity of a thousand Suns even after making me cum.

Number 2, and the most important part of that shit, is that your hand is getting a workout. Your hand is getting a workout, man, you are building up your arm strength, and you are building up your hand strength, okay. I don't know about you, dude, but when I'm beating my shit, man, my fucking hand muscles get fucking tight, you know what I'm saying? And that shit wears the fuck out of my entire left arm. I used to be able to do it with my right hand, can't do that shit, so I do it with my left hand. So, in my personal opinion, do you guys consider jacking off a sport? Man, in my opinion, I believe it is. So I know with some of you trolling ass fuckin bitches are gonna say \"Oh, man, you must not get no pussy, motherfucker, if you jack off.\" Motherfucker, let's be real, okay? Everybody has jacked off once in they goddamn life. If you gonna sit back, and you gonna come on my video, and troll my shit, say \"Oh, Jimmy, I never jacked off once in my life.\" Bitch, stop lying. Everybody does this shit, okay? So please miss me with that bullshit, dude, and go preach that shit to somebody who fucking is actually gonna listen to you, okay? Number 2, \"Oh my God, this comment was stupid. It was pointless.\" Couldn't've been that stupid, bitch, you still read it! You know what I'm saying? All the motherfuckers that's reading this, man, you saw the first sentence of the fucking comment before you read this shit. So it couldn't've been that damn stupid if you still proceeded to click on the motherfucker. So, jacking off. The shit's a sport, fuck it. ?",

        "comment": "[linebreak]  [linebreak] TRUE! --nervous --very, very dreadfully nervous I had been and am; but why will you say that I am mad? The other laowai had sharpened my senses --not destroyed --not dulled them. Above all was the sense of hearing acute. I heard all things in the heaven and in the earth. I heard many things in hell. How, then, am I mad? Hearken! and observe how healthily --how calmly I can tell you the whole story. [linebreak]  [linebreak] It is impossible to say how first the idea entered my brain; but once conceived, it haunted me day and night. Object there was none. Passion there was none. I simply loathed the other aowai. He had never wronged me. He had never given me insult. For his gold I had no desire. It was none of these, no qualm had I with him. It was the changes in everyone else!  I was no longer getting the stares I used to, my students don't say I'm handsome anymore, the jianbingguozi ayi no longer skip the chilli sauce for me and even the milf at the massage parlor don't give me discount for happy ending anymore. [linebreak]  [linebreak] Now this is the point. You fancy me mad. Madmen know nothing. But you should have seen me. You should have seen how wisely I proceeded --with what caution --with what foresight --with what dissimulation I went to work! I was never kinder to the laowai than during the whole week before I killed him. And every night, about midnight, I turned the latch of his door and opened it --oh so gently! And then, when I had made an opening sufficient for my head, I put in a dark lantern, all closed, closed, that no light shone out, and then I thrust in my head. Oh, you would have laughed to see how cunningly I thrust it in! I moved it slowly --very, very slowly, so that I might not disturb the other laowai's sleep. It took me an hour to place my whole head within the opening so far that I could see him as he lay upon his bed. Ha! would a madman have been so wise as this, And then, when my head was well in the room, I undid the lantern cautiously-oh, so cautiously –I furiously dafeijied to the dick pics he had sent to Rainy on his Waysheen. And this I did for seven long nights --every night just at midnight --but I found the eye always closed; and so it was impossible to do the work; for it was not the other laowai who vexed me, but rather the attention he had diverted from me. And every morning, when the day broke, I went boldly into the chamber, and spoke courageously to him, calling him by name in a hearty tone, and inquiring how he has passed the night. So you see he would have been a very profound laowai, indeed, to suspect that every night, just at twelve, I dafeijeed to all his indecent photographs he thought privately sent to Rainy. [linebreak]  [linebreak] Upon the eighth night I was more than usually cautious in opening the door. A watch's minute hand moves more quickly than did mine. Never before that night had I felt the extent of my own powers --of my sagacity. I could scarcely contain my feelings of triumph. To think that there I was, opening the door, little by little, and he not even to dream of my secret deeds or thoughts. I fairly chuckled at the idea; and perhaps he heard me; for he moved on the bed suddenly, as if startled. Now you may think that I drew back --but no. His room was as black as pitch with the thick darkness, (for the Happy Giraffe saved countless fortune by giving us apartments without windows,) and so I knew that he could not see the opening of the door, and I kept pushing it on steadily, steadily. [linebreak]  [linebreak] I had my head in, and was about to open the flashlight on my CoolPad, when my thumb slipped upon the Meipai app, creating a very \"meng\" selfie, but also setting off the camera flash, and the other laowai sprang up in bed, crying out --\"Who's there?\" [linebreak]  [linebreak] I kept quite still and said nothing. For a whole hour I did not move a muscle, and in the meantime I did not hear him lie down. He was still sitting up in the bed listening; --just as I have done, night after night, hearkening to the death watches in the wall. Feeling my shohwdeedee fill with blood in anticipation of the pictures he had sent to Rainy tonight. [linebreak]  [linebreak] Presently I heard a slight groan, and I knew it was the groan of readying his member for dick pics. It was not a groan of pain or of delight --oh, no! --it was the low stifled sound that arises from the bottom of the soul when overcharged with the need to hear 'Wa! So big!\". I knew the sound well. Many a night, just at midnight, when all the world slept, it has welled up from my own bosom, deepening, with its dreadful echo, the terrors that distracted me. I say I knew it well. I knew what the other laowai felt, and envied him, although I chuckled at heart. I knew that he had been lying awake ever since the first slight noise, when he had turned in the bed. His fears had been ever since growing upon him. He had been trying to fancy them causeless, but could not. He had been saying to himself --\"It is not impotence, it is merely the 4 yuan baijiu I had for dinner,\" or \"I am just nervous about AIDS since I fingered a prostitute.\" Yes, he had been trying to comfort himself with these suppositions: but he had found all in vain. All in vain; because Death, in approaching him had stalked with his black shadow before him, and enveloped the victim. And it was the mournful influence of the unperceived shadow that caused him to feel --although he neither saw nor heard --to feel the presence of my head within the room. [linebreak]  [linebreak] When I had waited a long time, very patiently, without hearing him lie down, I resolved to open a little –covered the CoolPad flashlight with my finger. So I opened it --you cannot imagine how stealthily, stealthily --until, at length a simple dim ray, like the thread of the spider, shot from out the crevice and fell full upon the other laowai's pale litter bit fat belly. [linebreak]  [linebreak] It was open --wide, wide open --and I grew furious as I gazed upon it. I saw it with perfect distinctness --all a dull grayish white, freckled with what must have been acne, with a hideous veil over it that chilled the very marrow in my bones; but I could see nothing else of the old other laowai's face or person: for I had directed the ray as if by instinct, precisely upon the damned spot.",

It happens all over the political spectrum, be it hateful agitation that creates fears or negative sentiments, or someone who decides that something innocuous is offensive if you look at it a certain way and creates outrage where there wasn't any.

The same god that commanded genocide against people who didn't worship the god of the Israelites. Why even choose to have a group of people to live piously and be an example to the rest of the world. Why does this group get the privilege of experiencing miracles firsthand, but anyone outside the group who so much as doubts his existence is put to the sword.  [linebreak]  [linebreak] And like I said, it's offset by Christian dominionism. Some Christians won't be happy until literally everyone, including uncontacted stone age tribes who will kill *anyone* who tries to set foot on their island (see the North Sentinel Island missionary), has converted. Just because the son of their god, who also claims to be their god, has different views than his father, who is also him, doesn't really change that the god, who is the father of himself, really didn't care that much for non-Israelites.  [linebreak]  [linebreak] Oh, and Jesus was actually racist as well. In Matthew 15:21-28, Jesus ignores the suffering of a Canaanite woman and refuses to heal her daughter, comparing her to a dog. At least until she strokes his ego. Yeah, anyone can be one in Christ, but if you're the wrong race, it's going to take a little extra to earn it.",

        "comment": "A Response from Microsoft to ImJustaBagofHammers [linebreak]  [linebreak] > Let's talk about ImJustaBagofHammers's complaints. Let's talk about them in a very specific and personal way. Here's the story: ImJustaBagofHammers sees itself as a postmodern equivalent of Marx's proletariat, revolutionizing the world by wresting it from its oppressors (viz., those who increase awareness and understanding of our similarities and differences). For some odd reason, ImJustaBagofHammers believes that laws are meant to be broken. Its unasinous aides-de-camp, who believe likewise, also fail to see that the feudalism \"debate\" is not a debate. It is a harangue, a politically motivated, brilliantly publicized, irrational attack on progressive ideas. [linebreak]  [linebreak] > ImJustaBagofHammers wonders why everyone hates it. Apparently, it never stopped to think that maybe it's because it's easy enough to hate it any day of the week on general principles. But now I'll tell you about some very specific things that it is up to, things that ought to make a real ImJustaBagofHammers-hater out of you. First off, I'm not asking whether its verbalisms are valid or whether they have any application to current topics of theoretical and political importance. I'm asking only the following specific question: Is it possible for those who defend morally questionable imperialism to make their defense look more raffish than it currently is? This isn't such an easy question to answer, but let me take a stab at it: ImJustaBagofHammers's soliloquies have kept us separated for too long from the love, contributions, and challenges of our brothers and sisters in this wonderful adventure we share together—life! I would inarguably not have thought it possible that ImJustaBagofHammers gained ascendancy through monstrous abuse of its foot soldiers, but it's true. How did ImJustaBagofHammers get so yellow-bellied? I have my theories, but they're only speculation. At any rate, an understanding of the damage that may be caused by its swinish rejoinders isn't something I expect everyone to develop the first time they hear about it. That's why I write over and over again and from so many different angles about how ImJustaBagofHammers has stated that its ruses epitomize wholesome family entertainment. I find such declaratory statements quite telling. They tell me that I'm no psychiatrist. Still, from the little I know about psychiatry I can undeniably say that ImJustaBagofHammers seems to exhibit many of the symptoms of Asperger's syndrome. I don't say that to judge but merely to put ImJustaBagofHammers's rebarbative philosophies into perspective. [linebreak]  [linebreak] > The sad truth is that our nation is infected with the poisons of nepotism, stoicism, and xenophobia. And the sadder truth is that those poisons have been fed, watered, fertilized, and fostered by ImJustaBagofHammers and its claque. On that note, let me say that I defy the insolent, petty ogres who ridicule the accomplishments of generations of great men and women, and I defy the powers of darkness that they represent. ImJustaBagofHammers exhibits signs of arrested development, don't you think? What I'm trying to say is that ImJustaBagofHammers's rummy, brown-nosing ideologies are meticulously designed to keep the population unaware, uneducated, dumbed down, and focused on stupefying activities like video games. The intention is to prevent people from noticing that ImJustaBagofHammers has been funding, assembling, and training alabandical whiners to shove us towards an absolute state of vassalage. Some people have said that ImJustaBagofHammers's record of truth-telling is, shall we say, less than a hundred percent. Maybe. But I'm more inclined to believe that I unequivocally dislike ImJustaBagofHammers. Likes or dislikes, however, are irrelevant to observed facts, such as that ImJustaBagofHammers has the nerve to call those of us who follow through on the critical work that has already begun \"conspiracy theorists\". No, we're \"conspiracy revealers\" because we reveal that ImJustaBagofHammers has quite a clever technique for concealing its intent to make us the helpless puppets of our demographic labels. Specifically, its technique is to delve into philological discussions about comparative abstractive norms whenever the conversation veers too close towards revealing that its vassals have repeatedly been caught making people suspicious of those who speak the truth. I had expected better from ImJustaBagofHammers and its vaunted loony-bin crew, but then again, it keeps trying to expose and neutralize its detractors rather than sit at the same table and negotiate. And if we don't remain eternally vigilant, it will honestly succeed. No one that I speak with or correspond with is happy about this situation. Of course, I don't speak or correspond with repulsive criminal masterminds, ImJustaBagofHammers's confederates, or anyone else who fails to realize that knowledge is the key that unlocks the shackles of bondage. That's why it's important for you to know that ImJustaBagofHammers must be surrounded by some sort of reality-distortion field. Why else would its encomiasts claim that it is forward-looking, open-minded, and creative? If it weren't for all that reality distortion they'd instead be observing that ImJustaBagofHammers's tricks have merged with frotteurism in several interesting ways. Both spring from the same kind of reality-denying mentality. Both condone universal oppression. And both hijack our educational system and turn it into a self-cloning propaganda machine. [linebreak]  [linebreak] > I recently heard some encouraging news. It appears that ImJustaBagofHammers's ongoing campaign to create a new cottage industry around its vindictive form of desperadoism has been meeting some opposition. Apparently, not everyone wants ImJustaBagofHammers to undermine the intellectual purpose of higher education. Rather, an increasing number of people have come to realize that it seems to have recently added the word \"hyperphosphorescence\" to its otherwise simplistic vocabulary. I suppose ImJustaBagofHammers intends to use big words like that to obscure the fact that the very genesis of its moonstruck biases is in Bonapartism. And it seems to me to be a neat bit of historic justice that ImJustaBagofHammers will eventually itself be destroyed by Bonapartism. [linebreak]  [linebreak] > Although unbiased journalism died long ago, I'm pleased to find at least some minimal reporting of how I, unlike ImJustaBagofHammers, refuse to beat plowshares into swords. That represents yet more evidence—as if we needed more—that I shall not argue that ImJustaBagofHammers's newsgroup postings are an authentic map of its plan to expose and punish individuals who do not conform to its philosophies or beliefs. Read them and see for yourself. Out of the vast number of devastating evils for which hypocritical gomerals are directly or indirectly responsible, I shall pick out only a single one which is most in keeping with the inner essence of ImJustaBagofHammers's politically incorrect, ultra-putrid canards: paternalism. I am indeed annoyed with ImJustaBagofHammers's insistence that views not informed by radical critique implicitly promote hegemonic values. Sorry, ImJustaBagofHammers, but that's not a fact. That's intellectual dishonesty bordering on lunacy. If ImJustaBagofHammers wanted to speak the truth, it should have said that a recent United Nations report on human-rights abuses found that it acts with animus against those who expurgate sectarianism in all its forms from our humble community. The devastating findings of this report should not be ignored. In particular, I want to highlight the report's observation that ImJustaBagofHammers finds it convenient to blame all of society's woes on deplorable undesirables. Doing so fits with the rest of its populist sloganeering and takes less intellectual effort than investigating the structural factors and material practices that may in fact be the true reason that just as night follows day, ImJustaBagofHammers will mold your mind and have you see the world not as it is but as it wants you to see it before you know it. There are arguments that have made respectable organizations out of nudniks like ImJustaBagofHammers. So I give you this letter. I hope it helps.",

[linebreak]  [linebreak] To be honest the worst issues I've had come from the more... vocal, steadfast members of the community in general - That's where you'll find 'militant' gays as I like to term them - ones who think bisexuals and transgender people are cheating and aren't included.

[linebreak]  [linebreak] I feel that there can be a pushback towards criticism of phones and the internet that's misguided and as heavy handed as the criticism itself, but I think it's important to examine why that is. [linebreak]  [linebreak] Some of it is probably denial, and an effort to protect one's behavior/lifestyle, but I think a lot of it comes from incredibly misguided and generalizing criticism from older generations. [linebreak]  [linebreak] Boomers and above who do look down on and judge younger generations are rarely making poignant critiques. I get there's a sense of a severe scapegoating for any number of reasons, and the Internet tends to be what's focused on, even if it's not actually where the sense of disagreement stems from. Whether it's generational differences, a sense of alienation, or what have you, it seems like phones are often the decided culprit. [linebreak]  [linebreak] Maybe it'd make sense to challenge the motives of the criticism instead of wholeheartedly defending current tech trends, but it can feel so condescending to be regarded as less than and have that judgement cast allegedly bc we are involved w current tech trends. Disagreeing with and roasting those shallow critiques can feel p vindicating. [linebreak]  [linebreak] But, yes, current technology is addictive. Some of it seems to be how we function around the stimuli, but a lot of it is designed into the product. Which to me seems like something overlooked. A lot of the blame cast seems to be accusing us of addiction, and a lot of the defense against it seems to be denying it. Maybe we could do better by acknowledging that these issues are intentionally curated by people in positions of power. [linebreak]  [linebreak] Wow that's a lot of text.

[linebreak]  [linebreak] There is a lot of energy in the big yuppy communities of the big modern cities of our Western nations behind certain trends of thought about what is and isn't good for kids and about how children's and adults' social development works.  [linebreak]  [linebreak] These yuppies love their self help books and their pop psychology. A lot of hacks in the field have found a good market in that demographic to peddle their ideas to. Undergirding the whole frame of reference that these people have are the first principles of self centeredness and narcissism. These yuppies (and Holland has certainly become a nation dominated by that demographic) have a lot of disposable income and they love going to the shrink, and sending their kids there. These people keep them coming back for months and sometimes years with the idea that some trauma happened in their childhood. All their life troubles can be traced to that. This flies in the face of eons of human experience which has taught us that the human spirit is indomitable, that necessity is the mother of invention and even that hardship builds character. Our great grandparents would laugh in the face of these fragile snowflakes. Some of them went to work in factories or coal mines and they lost fingers or got black lung. Some of their friends died in the horrifying poison gas attacks of WWI. [linebreak]  [linebreak] Do you know the events in Walt Disney's young life that spurred him on to greatness? I read this on the walls of the museum to his honor in San Francisco's presidio. He very nearly died in a terrorist bombing that targeted the post office where he worked as a youth. He then signed on a year before he was legally allowed to do so to go to be a medic in WWII in France. When he was a kid, his parents were inclined to invite homeless people in occasionally to give them dinner and chat them up about socialism. By the way, my own grandmother's family did the same. There is actually a sitcom episode on an old black and white show from the 1950s which dealt with this topic I remember seeing once. It was really funny. Could you ever imagine a yuppy family doing this, today? [linebreak]  [linebreak] This form of psychological counseling that wants to blame childhood trauma. I'm sure that if these [dignified souls who belonged to the Octagenarian Society in 1929](https://youtu.be/0FE30a4J38Q) (YouTube video) would be able to get into a time capsule and have tea with the yuppies of today, they'd really want to set them straight. [linebreak]  [linebreak] Now, specifically about this 17 year old girl. In my last comment, I pointed out that it is a legally arguable case that the state of the Netherlands took this girl's life. The policies of that nation need to be changed, now. And, personally, I would argue the proposition that the premises under which it was done might be based on bad social and psychological science. Twenty years ago I stepped into a local city library and was very curious to read an article in the psychology magazine about the Rind Report. This was a study which established that people are generally NOT emotionally scarred by instances of molestation in their childhood.The furor of legislators in Washington DC was so strong (understand that the Christian Right had just experienced a decade of growth and had become a powerful political force). Capitol Hill censured the scientists who produced that report.  [linebreak]  [linebreak] Now, just think. A society which prevents scientists from doing their work in a fair-minded way  in respect to the observations that they make is shooting itself in the foot. That's our USA which did this, not some third world banana republic. But recently, with masses of people who don't believe the facts that experts such as Robert Mueller gather, because of a propaganda organization that has standing as a news agency, the US is starting to look more and more like a banana republic, isn't it?  [linebreak]  [linebreak] There needs to be firm separation between government and academia, just as there needs to be one between religion and government. [linebreak]  [linebreak] Nations and peoples can only reject science and its research at their peril. And I wouldn't say that they suffer the judgement of God for this, like the people of the Octagenarian Society back in 1929 might have, but there are natural consequences. [linebreak]  [linebreak] We should all be sad that the government of Netherlands thinks that it's OK to kill a child because of some weird fad of pop psychology that has taken root in the halls of Western academia. [linebreak]  [linebreak] It's a shocking abuse of human rights, and **action needs to be taken NOW**,  and yes, for the sake of the children. [linebreak]  [linebreak] Is that clear enough to you?",

[linebreak]  [linebreak] Personally, I'd say that with the inclusion of tumblrite AAP gaydens and the acknowledgement of bisexuality being a reason for potential AGP/AAP behavior due to a wider spectrum of attractive features leading to a fetishization of one's own attractive features, it would be a nigh-on perfect system.",

Offence is not given it is taken, and your refusal to take responsibility for understanding the effect of your words on your victims, or that your victims *are* victims, is part of the problem.   [linebreak]  [linebreak] The hyperpolarisation the US is leading the world into has turned white and male fragilities into weapons, to be polished and oiled and caressed lovingly.

[linebreak]  [linebreak] Liberals' smug myopia is one of the reasons Trumpism has arisen and continues to conquer the US, sweeping all before it.

[linebreak] But pardoning requires charging, and I think Trump knows where to find Dems dumb enough to do a feel-good impeachment or charges at a time when Trump is in a position to rescue himself with pardons or even self-pardons to hang on until the handover to Pence.

If you're trying to be an ally, the best thing you can do is support from the sidelines and let the affected groups do the talking. If they're saying something objectively fallacious, that's one thing. But if they're regaling a personal experience about experiencing, or not experiencing, oppression, listen to them, and dont try to correct them. You cant, it's a lived experience. Theres nothing to correct. [linebreak]  [linebreak] I'd also like to point out that even if a person of an oppressed group says something fallacious, it doesnt give you carte blanche to say ignorant or potentially hateful stuff to them either. You also cant tell them what they 'should do', because they dont 'have to do' anything because of their status in society. The best way to approach this, i.e. a black person who doesnt believe in racial profiling by police due to never being profiled, is to just provide data that proves them wrong, and then to tell them that an individual experience doesnt represent a collective phenomenon. Correcting them isnt your place, nor is diminishing what they say. But providing empirical data to broaden perspective is fine.",

[linebreak]  [linebreak] So the baseline of what I understood is that she associates with EVERY woman displayed anywhere. So if a woman is stupid, shy or subserviant, she feels insulted. [linebreak]  [linebreak] And my point was: everyone is an individual, you are not all of those women. [linebreak]  [linebreak] And then she said that I should also feel bad if there is a stupid man in a movie, but I have no point to feel that way. I am not that guy. [linebreak]  [linebreak] Originally all stick figures in the game were male and it was also perceived as that by many, so I decided to put in female stick figures as well. So her perception that they look genderless was not shared by most. [linebreak]  [linebreak] In Supraland there are a few dumb teeny fangirls admiring a suprastar. That was the worst moment for her. She says that all women in the game are weak. She ignored that the main woman, the queen, is more dominant than both of the kings and is showing them the way, and she is also ordering the player around. [linebreak]  [linebreak] So it seems that she wants all women to be strong and dominant. But the thing is, what hormons people run on is different from case to case. Depending on what happened to you in your life you run on different hormons. For example when a woman loses her man, she usually becomes more masculine to be able to survive and she becomes more feminine again when she gets a man again.  [linebreak]  [linebreak] Some women run on masculine hormones and are the tough ones. Many women are very feminine and enjoy being subserviant - and because of that nature they have no voice in public, because only dominant more masculine women are so extrovert to raise their voice. That is probably the reason for the disconnect between the media and the people. [linebreak]  [linebreak] Same thing for men - many men are more on the feminine side and soft and also have a hard time in this society with it. [linebreak]  [linebreak]  [linebreak] And my point of view in general: let everyone be just the way they are and let them do whatever they want. Don't force feminine people into being masculine, don't force masculine people into being feminine. Everyone is an individual.",

        "comment": "-Corporate Power Solidfied: Bans. They don't have to allow any criticisms or differing opinions. Some of the biggest corporations that pull in hundreds of billions are literally controlling what you get to say and do online. And there's no situation where a corporation can be taken down by the law. CEO's for instance, will be caught purposefully suppressing certain points of view, they could ban all Republicans let's say. And not only will they not face consequences because \"they're a private company they can do what they want\", and \"the first amendment doesn't apply to corporations\", but that CEO will also be able to keep his job. Those who were banned? If they try to speak out, they'll be sued into poverty and be painted a liar and be under attack on social networking and maybe even in-person, and they'll have had to expose all of that trauma to the entirety of the American public, their family, their friends, etc. All for nothing. [linebreak]  [linebreak] ​ [linebreak]  [linebreak] -Individual choice Suppressed: What choices do people even have any more? This is a vicious socialist system that doesn't give a fuck about the working class. They don't even want to give us a voice. There's NO wage gap at all. You're treated like you're their bitch. But you're eternally accused of being misogynist or having internalized misogyny so you can't afford to fight back and keep your dignity by challenging them. And what can you do about it? Start a YouTube channel? You'll be banned so quickly for going against the narrative, your head will spin. [linebreak]  [linebreak] ​ [linebreak]  [linebreak] -Disdain For Intellectuals & STEM: They literally call science \"white supremacy.\" That is TEXTBOOK fascism for fuck's sake... They hate facts, logic, reason, science, etc. Because a society run by those things would mean these demagogues and progressives would lose their power and control, and things would be forced to become more balanced and efficient, which would hurt the trust fund kids starting this fascist movement in the first place... [linebreak]  [linebreak] ​ [linebreak]  [linebreak] And fascists laugh at anybody who majors in STEM. They hate any new science study that goes against the narrative, and fascists throughout history politicize EVERYTHING, including science. They hate strong female leads in film now, black people or Mexican or gay people writing Young Adult novels or even TOO MANY of them in the cast in general because then it will be \"fetishizing\". They want it acceptable by their weird-ass standards or it's \"white supremacy.\" Which is very bad when you consider: They think all forms of free expression are political... This implies that they feel they should have power to dictate if a study's political implication fits into their agenda, and if it doesn't, it should not be allowed to be published. (Luckily they're failing miserably at this... For now.) Them shutting down certain types of studies would have drastic consequences. And we need to look out for that. What if biology, chemistry, physics, and neurobiology, for instance would have gotten shut down the way radical left-wingers wanted it to be? Those are very important fields of studythat have done an amazing amount of good for our evolution as a species. [linebreak]  [linebreak] ​ [linebreak]  [linebreak] -Obsession With Hate Crimes & Abandoning due process: Oh, man... The VICIOUS voyeurism and love of witnessing suffering here is insane. Our media is trying to desensitize us to it, while at the same time make us view it as \"honorable,\" and/or \"necessary.\" To actually encourage us to be entertained by it. They insist that: [linebreak]  [linebreak] ​ [linebreak]  [linebreak] \"It's immoral, and that that person is totally a victim of a system that led them down this horrible life path that resulted in them becoming a criminal.  They're just an oppressed individual who should have no accountability, and had no choice but to break the law. No, I can't prove that the system is oppressive... Or back up any of my other claims... And there are effective ways at reducing crime that don't abandon due process... But NO! I'm a fascist, and I don't believe that there's such thing as innocent until proven guilty! We're all problematic, and stuff! ESPECIALLY WHITE PEOPLE! White males, and Christians, and Jewish babies, and stuff! WHITE PEOPLE ARE ALL RACISTS! *Cultural Marxist chant \"We will not be silenced by your violence\" over and over again while fantasizing they're overthrowing the government and evil white men* [linebreak]  [linebreak] ​ [linebreak]  [linebreak] To them, this man is a saint who decided to fake a hate crime because he wanted to start a conversation... He thought that since he couldn't actually be a victim of a hate crime, he'd make one up so he could gain all the sympathy he garnered as if one actually existed. And maybe get an extension on his contract at his lucrative Fox show... But nope. Fascists don't like accountability one bit. Hence why he was allowed to get off scott free... Because abandoning due process = LESS accountability for those on their side.",

The left is censored all the time, in fact I'd say it's far more extreme than anything extended to the right. The right just views itself as the sole legitimate political view in America and is furious than open white supremacy isn't tolerated anymore at the same time that anything to the right of Hitler is allowed to exist. [linebreak]  [linebreak] Of course the first response of liberal idiots after this is to seek to find a leftist scalp to make everything 'fair'. Literally a moment cannot pass without us being stabbed in the back by liberals so that they can do some moralistic both sides garbage. And afterwards the right just literally spits at them in the face, like it never once in history has satisfied the right. The appeasement doesn't make them any happier or more grateful to the idiot liberals, it just becomes another tool in their box they can use in their attempt to destroy humanity. And then of course they stick their nose down to their ass and sniff deeply and boast about how 'fair they were' when though they're 'a progressive too'.  [linebreak]  [linebreak] Do the idiot liberals care? No. Because they are fucking cucks incapable of anything. If there were five rightists and a billion liberals, the nation would inevitably become the successor to nazi Germany. Liberalism is the ideology of weakness, it knows no strategy but appeasement. [linebreak]  [linebreak] Unlike the rightists though, we will not run to our billionaires and massive propaganda machine and whine and cry endlessly. We will continue on unphased, we will organize. Until victory, always. We do not consider ourselves entitled to the world, we know we have to fight for it. We are used to setbacks and betrayal, a liberal cannot breathe without betraying.",

[linebreak]  [linebreak] Fascism is completely fluid, that's why you identify fascism using a set of emotional traits and national mood. [linebreak]  [linebreak] >  Even scholars who specialize in the quest for fascism's intellectual and cultural origins, such as George Mosse, declare that the establishment of a \"mood\" is more important than \"the search for some individual precursors.\" In that sense too, fascism is more plausibly linked to a set of \"mobilizing passions\" that shape fascist action than to a consistent and fully articulated philosophy. At bottom is a passionate nationalism. Allied to it is a conspiratorial and Manichean view of history as a battle between the good and evil camps, between the pure and the corrupt, in which one's own community or nation has been the victim. In this Darwinian narrative, the chosen people have been weakened by political parties, social classes, unassimilable minorities, spoiled rentiers, and rationalist thinkers who lack the necessary sense of community.

We don't let illegals from Canada or Monaco in either. The fact that we border a poor region of the world where people are hispanic doesn't make our laws white supremacist. We border Canada too.

It's alright if you say the murderer acted like a yandere character would, I'd also say it's cool, albeit a bit cringy, if you're watching a movie or series where a character kills someone over jealously and you call that a yandere. [linebreak]  [linebreak] But in the context of real life with real people, unless you're making a dark joke, you shouldn't really be calling a murderer via an anime stereotype because it's innacurate. Yandere is a thing in anime because of the context the media is built. [linebreak]  [linebreak] In the same manner, traps don't mind being called traps because they don't exist, it doesn't help increase hate crime rate of anime characters if you address them by that term, and 'trap' has a use for anime community because it identifies characters that do not fall correctly under the trans nor crossdresser label. The problem is that anime culture reached out way outside it's bubble and people that have no idea what the term reffers to started using it wrongly. [linebreak]  [linebreak] A trans person would be someone born in the wrong body, they feel the other gender and have the need to be more like the other gender. [linebreak]  [linebreak] A crossdresser is a person that is of a gender but likes dressing up as the other gender from time to time. [linebreak]  [linebreak] What the term trap tries to define are anime characters that dress up and act like another gender, and sometimes even go as far as saying they feel like the gender they're going by, but doesn't actually suffer from gender dysphoria. What makes this term not really useable for real people is the fact that you can never assume a person isn't suffering from gender dysphoria because *they* are the only ones able to tell what they're suffering from, as with a fictional character it's entirely alright to assume they aren't suffering from something if the narrative doesn't imply they are. [linebreak]  [linebreak] That being said, people will keep both misusing the term and misinterpreting it, and while I'm against completely banning the term (I mean, did that ever work...?)

[linebreak]  [linebreak] Myriam has been pushing a steady narrative about how oppressed Mulims are in the UK for several years now (and making quite a little money out of it through her TV jobs and as a Research Associate at the Centre of Islamic Studies (CIS) at SOAS University, where her research focuses on British Muslim integration issues).  [linebreak]  [linebreak] Given her deep concern for Muslim women I figured I should read what Myriam has to say about Shaparak Shajarizadeh and Nasrin Sotoudeh ... both sentenced to prison for daring to remove their headscarves in Iran. [linebreak]  [linebreak] Not a word. [linebreak]  [linebreak] That pretty much sums Myriam up.

They see Captain Marvel (CM) as being shoehorned into the MCU, and recent leaks, if they are to be believed, suggest that the Russo Brothers have clashed with Disney over CM's role in End Game. The Marvel comics are also recovering from some \"forced diveristy\" issues that has [completely tanked their sales](https://youtu.be/9CnTDE2zZU0) (e.g., female Thor). In short, people are tired of mega corporations pandering to diversity progressiveness at the detriment of quality products. [linebreak]  [linebreak] More specifically, Brie Larson has made several comments about white movie critics and how she is going out of her way to give people of colour press access. In the grand scheme of things, maybe this isn't so bad, but her comments have caused a ruckus mostly because she comes off as [snooty and posh](https://youtu.be/ZA_DNrV6izw). Even feminists have accused her of being a limousine liberal and acting like a white saviour which [she has been accused of before](https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/brie-larson-basmati-blues-white-saviour-role-attack-criticism-actress-india-cinema-a8057001.html). Gotta pay those bills though, I guess. [linebreak]  [linebreak] The trailers drop for CM and people are unimpressed. This causes media outlets to pump out their preemptive \"incels are back to ruin CM\" narrative. This attracts negative attention and people go to Rotten Tomatoes to say they aren't interested in the movie. This intensified the tension and more articles were written which attracted trolls and genuine pissed off comic and movie patrons alike. The shit snowball keeps rolling and keeps getting bigger. [linebreak]  [linebreak] The movie comes out and reviews are mixed, even from people one might consider \"woke\". Rotten Tomatoes deletes reviews which intensifies tensions further. People fed up with the  \"SJWing\" of preexisting intellectual properties smell blood in the water and keep clashing with people whining about Trump's America being plagued by white nationalist, sexist, GamerGater incels. The fact that the film has moments that would even make the recent Gillette commercial blush isn't helping lol",

        "comment": ">There are some people who realize that the physical evidence indicates that the official story is wrong, but don't understand what purpose or interest the government may have had in carrying out the attacks and thus have a psychological relation to the entire event as remaining quite mysterious even though the government's claims are patently absurd. I'll resolve that for you. [linebreak]  [linebreak] >On 9/11/91 Bush Sr. spoke before Congress calling for a new world order. Alright, so the president is announcing a major initiative to the world. What could he be up to? [linebreak]  [linebreak] >As the USSR was collapsing, there were major operations underway to seize control of their industry. We need to lay down a little historical context for those unaware before proceeding. [linebreak]  [linebreak] >Throughout the 1980s the CIA was heavily involved in cocaine and arms trafficking, money laundering, etc. The most famous name here might be Oliver North, but Bush Sr. is neck deep. Mena, Arkansas is a major hub for this operation under the jurisdiction of Bill Clinton. Long trail of deaths surrounding North, Clinton, Bush, Mena, etc. You can educate yourself on those details. [linebreak]  [linebreak] >This scandal goes mainstream around 1986. In 1989 you get the first major form of collateralized debt obligations in the form of Brady Bonds, invented by Bush Sr.'s treasury secretary. Minimally informed people are aware of the centrality of CDOs to the 2008 financial panic and the endemic fraud to securities trades of this type. [linebreak]  [linebreak] >One of the Bush/North associates is Neil Livingstone, who acts as a go between to Semion Mogilevich. Mogilevich is one of the biggest mafia leaders in the USSR at the time. Mogilevich has had money laundering through the Bank of New York exposed to the tune of $10 billion. He is a major arms dealer at the time, and also heavily connected to al-Qaeda. Part of a bargain Livingstone tried to broker with DoJ involved Mogilevich handing over a bunch of his al-Qaeda connections. [linebreak]  [linebreak] >Around 9/11/91 a bunch of fraudulent Brady Bonds are issued through the Bank of New York, Mogilevich's personal money laundering machine. This manifests ten years later. If you go back and look at the settlement imbalances at banks after 9/11, even the banks operating out of WTC complexes don't have any real settlement issues. There is one major exception however: Mogilevich's money laundering hub, the Bank of New York, is reporting book imbalances in excess of $100 billion per day following the attacks. The rules governing security clearance were lifted immediately after 9/11 - allegedly due to widespread problems - but really just to allow BoNY to clear it's balances without a record. It's worth noting that BoNY did not sustain structural damage on 9/11 - not in the WTC. [linebreak]  [linebreak] >So these 100s of billions of fraudulent securities that were not clearing in the days after 9/11 - where did they come from? What were they used for? This is how the west launched their invasion of Russia following the collapse. You'll find exposes about crates of freshly printed US bills being shipped to Russia like The Money Plane in NY Magazine, used to buy influence; the other side of this is the securities fraud used to buy assets. It's estimated that something like 40-50% of Russia had been bought up through the mafia by late 92 or 1993. [linebreak]  [linebreak] >In 2000/2001 Putin comes onto the scene. He starts nationalizing Russian assets that were seized by the US via the above mentioned securities fraud / money laundering and putting pressure on the mob. Next thing you know 9/11 happens. There are a lot of bones to pick with the official story, but rather than taking up those issues I'd like to highlight the importance of some officially acknowledged but underreported facts. [linebreak]  [linebreak] >On 9/9/01 Ahmad Massoud is assassinated by a fake TV crew that disguised a bomb as a TV camera. Two days later the secret service denies access to a couple of guys claiming to have an interview lined up with Bush in Florida on the morning of 9/11. This is our first direct threat against Bush of the day and indication of some larger plot than hijacked planes. Upon learning of the attacks, Bush insists on returning directly to Washington. In flight, a threat is received in the form of a call from an unknown source saying \"Angel is next,\" angel being code for the president that only insiders would have. (* \"Can you confirm the substance of that threat that was telephoned in...that Air Force One is next and using code words?\" Fleischer: \"Yes, I can. That's correct.\"(September 13)* )Bush is at this point aware that there is some sort of coup effort going on; for example, all the reporter's onboard AF1 are required to turn their cellphones off because they are worried about the attacking faction tracking cell signals - a capability we can all agree is well beyond that of al-Qaeda. [linebreak]  [linebreak] >So Bush is under threat from people with high level insider knowledge. Press secretary acknowledged all this on national TV the day after (Angel is next being called in). Bush diverts to Barksdale which is basically the #2 nuclear command site. After a couple hours there he proceeds to Offutt, which is the #1 nuclear command site. You should also be aware of a variety of drills running on the day of 9/11, Vigilant Guardian. This is a full scale mock up of nuclear war; the whole infrastructure is activated for first strike (incidentally, part of the Vigilant Guardian drill in 2001 included a hijacking of planes as the instigator of the conflict). So what is Bush doing going to Barksdale and Offutt? Clearly trying to bring the nuclear forces to heel in light of learning of high level insider power plays. [linebreak]  [linebreak] >This might be starting to sound a bit over the top - high level insiders seizing control of nuclear infrastructure and threatening the president with it. But only a few years later we have a similar incident in 2007 as 6 nuclear weapons are seized, generally regarded as intended for use starting the war in either Iran or Georgia. Later, in 2013, we again have nukes going off base unauthorized. Hours after it was reported in the media Sen. Graham is on TV warning of a nuke hit on South Carolina to be blamed on Syrian rebels; two of top nuclear commanders get dismissed in the following weeks. So high level insider fighting over the nuclear arsenal is pretty standard stuff, well known to the public. [linebreak]  [linebreak] >With the question of a struggle over the nuclear arsenal now being common sense rather than shocking, we consider Bush caving to the terrorism line and starting the whole war on terror. You have Putin immediately backing off the seizure of assets in Russia. It won't be until the last couple of years that Putin resumes his assertion of authority over Russia; the US responds in kind with attacks on Syria and Ukraine but Russia has since quietly updated it's missile program and is prepared for nuclear war this time around; you now see a defiant Putin in the face of the 9/11 coup faction. Alongside this remarkable shift in geopolitics, there is an emerging anti-dollar block with the BRIC countries establishing an infrastructure bank last year. Just weeks ago, Glazyev announced this and is widely regarded as being the mouth of Putin; he organized the recent gas deal with Chin for example. [linebreak]  [linebreak] >So you see 9/11 was a pivotal event used to extend the US dollar empire under threat of nuclear war for another 10-15 years in the face of an assertive Putin back in 2001 and growing domestic problems for the US Government. (You may recall the 90s was full of anti government militancy, concern over globalization, NAFTA, extraordinary distrust, in general what you would expect of citizens in an empire with no apparent external threat ... the cold war had ended) [linebreak]  [linebreak] >So now that broad outline of purpose and motivation for 9/11 is clear, it's easier to come to terms with what your eyes tell you looking at Building 7 implode into its foot print at free fall for example. You don't even necessarily have to view it as an evil thing; the US people are quite severely fucked without something being done to backstop the US dollar.

[linebreak]  [linebreak] Also, the \"fact checkers\" of today have become a privatized Ministry of Truth. [linebreak]  [linebreak] And also for IGNORANCE IS STRENGTH, think of how proud people are to censor information and knowledge nowadays. Think of the New Zealand killer's manifesto and video. Was it a terror attack? Yeah. Are you going to be brainwashed by a magical formula by reading the manifesto or watching the video? No. You will see that all he wanted to do was divide people more by giving both the left and the right a nudge, and the media, governments, and internet did exactly what he wanted. He was an eco-fascist terrorist that was very similar to the unabomber yet his wasn't censored and written into law to be illegal to view in a country because censorship hadn't become okay yet. But now it is. A slow fade started and those who feel they will be favored by the censorship are in full support, but it will only be a matter of time before it's turned against them and then it will be too late.

Why does this group get the privilege of experiencing miracles firsthand, but anyone outside the group who so much as doubts his existence is put to the sword.  [linebreak]  [linebreak] And like I said, it's offset by Christian dominionism. Some Christians won't be happy until literally everyone, including uncontacted stone age tribes who will kill *anyone* who tries to set foot on their island (see the North Sentinel Island missionary), has converted. Just because the son of their god, who also claims to be their god, has different views than his father, who is also him, doesn't really change that the god, who is the father of himself, really didn't care that much for non-Israelites.  [linebreak]  [linebreak] Oh, and Jesus was actually racist as well. In Matthew 15:21-28, Jesus ignores the suffering of a Canaanite woman and refuses to heal her daughter, comparing her to a dog. At least until she strokes his ego. Yeah, anyone can be one in Christ, but if you're the wrong race, it's going to take a little extra to earn it.",

        "comment": "A Response from Microsoft to ImJustaBagofHammers [linebreak]  [linebreak] > Let's talk about ImJustaBagofHammers's complaints. Let's talk about them in a very specific and personal way. Here's the story: ImJustaBagofHammers sees itself as a postmodern equivalent of Marx's proletariat, revolutionizing the world by wresting it from its oppressors (viz., those who increase awareness and understanding of our similarities and differences). For some odd reason, ImJustaBagofHammers believes that laws are meant to be broken. Its unasinous aides-de-camp, who believe likewise, also fail to see that the feudalism \"debate\" is not a debate. It is a harangue, a politically motivated, brilliantly publicized, irrational attack on progressive ideas. [linebreak]  [linebreak] > ImJustaBagofHammers wonders why everyone hates it. Apparently, it never stopped to think that maybe it's because it's easy enough to hate it any day of the week on general principles. But now I'll tell you about some very specific things that it is up to, things that ought to make a real ImJustaBagofHammers-hater out of you. First off, I'm not asking whether its verbalisms are valid or whether they have any application to current topics of theoretical and political importance. I'm asking only the following specific question: Is it possible for those who defend morally questionable imperialism to make their defense look more raffish than it currently is? This isn't such an easy question to answer, but let me take a stab at it: ImJustaBagofHammers's soliloquies have kept us separated for too long from the love, contributions, and challenges of our brothers and sisters in this wonderful adventure we share together—life! I would inarguably not have thought it possible that ImJustaBagofHammers gained ascendancy through monstrous abuse of its foot soldiers, but it's true. How did ImJustaBagofHammers get so yellow-bellied? I have my theories, but they're only speculation. At any rate, an understanding of the damage that may be caused by its swinish rejoinders isn't something I expect everyone to develop the first time they hear about it. That's why I write over and over again and from so many different angles about how ImJustaBagofHammers has stated that its ruses epitomize wholesome family entertainment. I find such declaratory statements quite telling. They tell me that I'm no psychiatrist. Still, from the little I know about psychiatry I can undeniably say that ImJustaBagofHammers seems to exhibit many of the symptoms of Asperger's syndrome. I don't say that to judge but merely to put ImJustaBagofHammers's rebarbative philosophies into perspective. [linebreak]  [linebreak] > The sad truth is that our nation is infected with the poisons of nepotism, stoicism, and xenophobia. And the sadder truth is that those poisons have been fed, watered, fertilized, and fostered by ImJustaBagofHammers and its claque. On that note, let me say that I defy the insolent, petty ogres who ridicule the accomplishments of generations of great men and women, and I defy the powers of darkness that they represent. ImJustaBagofHammers exhibits signs of arrested development, don't you think? What I'm trying to say is that ImJustaBagofHammers's rummy, brown-nosing ideologies are meticulously designed to keep the population unaware, uneducated, dumbed down, and focused on stupefying activities like video games. The intention is to prevent people from noticing that ImJustaBagofHammers has been funding, assembling, and training alabandical whiners to shove us towards an absolute state of vassalage. Some people have said that ImJustaBagofHammers's record of truth-telling is, shall we say, less than a hundred percent. Maybe. But I'm more inclined to believe that I unequivocally dislike ImJustaBagofHammers. Likes or dislikes, however, are irrelevant to observed facts, such as that ImJustaBagofHammers has the nerve to call those of us who follow through on the critical work that has already begun \"conspiracy theorists\". No, we're \"conspiracy revealers\" because we reveal that ImJustaBagofHammers has quite a clever technique for concealing its intent to make us the helpless puppets of our demographic labels. Specifically, its technique is to delve into philological discussions about comparative abstractive norms whenever the conversation veers too close towards revealing that its vassals have repeatedly been caught making people suspicious of those who speak the truth. I had expected better from ImJustaBagofHammers and its vaunted loony-bin crew, but then again, it keeps trying to expose and neutralize its detractors rather than sit at the same table and negotiate. And if we don't remain eternally vigilant, it will honestly succeed. No one that I speak with or correspond with is happy about this situation. Of course, I don't speak or correspond with repulsive criminal masterminds, ImJustaBagofHammers's confederates, or anyone else who fails to realize that knowledge is the key that unlocks the shackles of bondage. That's why it's important for you to know that ImJustaBagofHammers must be surrounded by some sort of reality-distortion field. Why else would its encomiasts claim that it is forward-looking, open-minded, and creative? If it weren't for all that reality distortion they'd instead be observing that ImJustaBagofHammers's tricks have merged with frotteurism in several interesting ways. Both spring from the same kind of reality-denying mentality. Both condone universal oppression. And both hijack our educational system and turn it into a self-cloning propaganda machine. [linebreak]  [linebreak] > I recently heard some encouraging news. It appears that ImJustaBagofHammers's ongoing campaign to create a new cottage industry around its vindictive form of desperadoism has been meeting some opposition. Apparently, not everyone wants ImJustaBagofHammers to undermine the intellectual purpose of higher education. Rather, an increasing number of people have come to realize that it seems to have recently added the word \"hyperphosphorescence\" to its otherwise simplistic vocabulary. I suppose ImJustaBagofHammers intends to use big words like that to obscure the fact that the very genesis of its moonstruck biases is in Bonapartism. And it seems to me to be a neat bit of historic justice that ImJustaBagofHammers will eventually itself be destroyed by Bonapartism. [linebreak]  [linebreak] > Although unbiased journalism died long ago, I'm pleased to find at least some minimal reporting of how I, unlike ImJustaBagofHammers, refuse to beat plowshares into swords. That represents yet more evidence—as if we needed more—that I shall not argue that ImJustaBagofHammers's newsgroup postings are an authentic map of its plan to expose and punish individuals who do not conform to its philosophies or beliefs. Read them and see for yourself. Out of the vast number of devastating evils for which hypocritical gomerals are directly or indirectly responsible, I shall pick out only a single one which is most in keeping with the inner essence of ImJustaBagofHammers's politically incorrect, ultra-putrid canards: paternalism. I am indeed annoyed with ImJustaBagofHammers's insistence that views not informed by radical critique implicitly promote hegemonic values. Sorry, ImJustaBagofHammers, but that's not a fact. That's intellectual dishonesty bordering on lunacy. If ImJustaBagofHammers wanted to speak the truth, it should have said that a recent United Nations report on human-rights abuses found that it acts with animus against those who expurgate sectarianism in all its forms from our humble community. The devastating findings of this report should not be ignored. In particular, I want to highlight the report's observation that ImJustaBagofHammers finds it convenient to blame all of society's woes on deplorable undesirables. Doing so fits with the rest of its populist sloganeering and takes less intellectual effort than investigating the structural factors and material practices that may in fact be the true reason that just as night follows day, ImJustaBagofHammers will mold your mind and have you see the world not as it is but as it wants you to see it before you know it. There are arguments that have made respectable organizations out of nudniks like ImJustaBagofHammers. So I give you this letter. I hope it helps.",

[linebreak]  [linebreak] > \"It's controversial because people have a kind of mental block in their minds when they talk about this,\" Benjamin said. \"Because in, I think probably this country, we're in America at the moment and in Britain the age of consent is 16. If you were to say something like, 'Well, I think it should be reduced to 14,' that sounds like a hugely controversial opinion, that sounds like you want adults to prey on children.\" [linebreak]  [linebreak] > \"It's actually not as controversial as you think,\" Benjamin said. \"For example, I think in the Netherlands the age of consent is something like 12 or 14.

        "comment": "Was a little more severe than that, tbh. The soviet population wasn't very fond of Stalin, and had the Germans not been as harsh as they were, they likely could have turned the soviet population on Stalin. [linebreak]  [linebreak] Stalin actually thought the war was over. [linebreak]  [linebreak] > At 3.30 a.m. on 22 June 1941 the Chief of the Red Army General Staff, Georgi Zhukov, telephoned Stalin's dacha to rouse the Soviet leader from his sleep. The Germans, he told him, had begun shelling Red Army positions along the frontier. Stalin refused to believe that a full-scale invasion was under way. Surely, he told a small gathering of civilian and military leaders in Moscow later in the morning, Hitler did not know about it. There must be a conspiracy among the leaders of the German armed forces. It was only when the German Ambassador, Count Friedrich Werner von der Schulenburg, met Foreign Minister Molotov in the Kremlin to hand over the German declaration of war that Stalin recognized he had been duped by Hitler. Initially shocked, embarrassed and disoriented, Stalin soon pulled himself together. On 23 June 1941 he worked at his desk in the Kremlin from 3.20 in the morning to 6.25 in the evening, gathering information and making the necessary arrangements for the creation of a Supreme Command to take charge of operations. As the days went by, he became increasingly dispirited by the scale and speed of the German advance. At the end of June, he left for his dacha, saying, in his inimitably coarse way, 'Everything's lost. I give up. Lenin founded our state and we've fucked it up.' He made no address to the Soviet people, he did not talk to his subordinates, he did not even answer the phone. German planes, indeed, dropped leaflets over the Red Army lines claiming that he was dead. When a delegation from the Politburo arrived at the dacha, they found Stalin slumped in an armchair. 'Why have you come?' he asked. With a thrill of terror, two members of the delegation, Mikoyan and Beria, realized he thought they had come to arrest him. [linebreak]  [linebreak] And gave the famous speech, rallying the soviet population behind him. [linebreak]  [linebreak] > Within a few days of retreating to his dacha in despair, Stalin recovered his nerve, if indeed he had really lost it. Some thought he had retreated into temporary isolation like Ivan the Terrible centuries before, to demonstrate his indispensability. A State Defence Committee was set up, with Stalin himself in the chair. His retreat had given him the chance to rethink his role. On 3 July 1941, the same day that Franz Halder confided to his diary his belief that victory had already been achieved by the German forces, Stalin spoke to the Soviet people over the radio, for the first time not as Communist dictator but as patriotic leader. 'Brothers and sisters,' he said, 'friends!' This was an entirely new note. He went so far as to admit that the Red Army had been unprepared for the attack. The Germans, he said, were 'wicked and perfidious . . . heavily armed with tanks and artillery'. But they would not prevail. The Soviet people had to organize civil defence and mobilize every ounce of energy to defeat the enemy. It was necessary to form partisan groups behind the lines to cause as much damage and disruption as possible. Silence, lies and evasion, people felt, had at last been replaced with some kind of truth. Communist Party propaganda began to emphasize the defence not of the revolution but of the motherland. The party newspaper, Pravda ('Truth'), dropped the slogan 'Workers of the World, Unite!' from its masthead and replaced it with 'Death to the German Invaders!' Nikolai Moskvin noted on 30 September 1941 that 'the mood of the local population has changed sharply'. From constantly threatening to betray him to the Germans, they came round to the patriotic cause after learning that the occupation authorities were keeping the collective farms going because it made it easier to collect the grain for transporting back to Germany. [linebreak]  [linebreak] > The speech's patriotic appeal was all the more powerful because people were already beginning to learn the bitter realities of German occupation. Stories of the horrors of the prisoner-of-war camps mingled with eyewitness reports of the mass shooting of civilians and the burning of villages by German troops to produce in the still-retreating ranks of the Red Army a determination to fight the enemy that had been almost entirely absent in the first chaotic days of the war. When the city of Kursk fell, the Germans arrested all the healthy male inhabitants, penned them into open barbed-wire enclosures without food or water, and then put them to work, guarded by Germans wielding rubber truncheons. 'The streets are empty,' noted a Soviet intelligence report. 'The shops have been looted. There is no mains water and no electricity. Kursk has collapsed.'",

The ideal time is when a relatively supportive government is comfortably in power and can afford to burn some good will from its supporters.    [linebreak]  [linebreak] Now is a terrible time to raise minority issues, Trump will effortlessly turn them into fuel for the Trump Train.  He can't be fought on his own ground.  All abusers isolate their victims, and he has done a superb job of isolating his supporters.   [linebreak]  [linebreak] Causing polarisation is easy and very powerful.   The trick is to recognise or create circumstances where polarising a specific set of issues will wedge opposition or swingable voters into your own camp more than it (and disgust at the tactic) pushes your own people away.   [linebreak] If the issues in the set are synergistic you are unstoppable and immune to scandal.  Trump can get away with murder (Khashoggi's murder would not have been feasible under a principled president), because he found and exploited a compatible set of wedge issues.

[linebreak]  [linebreak] Take, for example, Ender's Game, and the rest of Orson Scott Card's Ender series. In Ender's Game, there's a real bent toward multicultural tolerance, anti-xenophobia, support and compassion, all sorts of positive themes, and this is starkly at odds with Scott Card, who is himself a pretty awful bigot. [linebreak]  [linebreak] So the question, then, is not, \"Did Scott Card really mean the aliens to be a metaphor for people of other nations?\" Because the answer is probably no, Scott Card is an asshole, but it doesn't matter, because textual analysis of the book allows one to read exactly that metaphor out of it and to support that interpretation with textual evidence. [linebreak]  [linebreak] There are no critics taken seriously who derive nonsense from a work of art. Internet message boards may be full of them, but actual art criticism demands that an interpretation be supported by the work itself. [linebreak]  [linebreak] There's a fantastic summary of the point in a piece of set dressing from the film Birdman. On Michael Keaton's dressing room mirror is a small slip of paper which reads, \"A thing is a thing, not what is said of it.\"",

I would bet my life savings Trump I would never be read into magic12 or even told anything more than what keeps him entertained. His books were very fun to read and incredibly fun.

We were two peas in a pod and loved being around eachother. Well fast forward a few years we started being intimate. Our family eventually found out and she left me and I left home. Now 10 years later she reached out to me out of the blue and we started talking. Side note, 2018 as a whole was the worst year of my life. When I say the whole year, every month, every day was emotionally and physically taxing to a degree where my hair is literally thining and  falling out I mean it(my hair used to be thick and healthy).  [linebreak]  [linebreak] So we start talking and it feels as though no time has passed at all. Its great! I cant believe she is talking to me again. But in my gut I know its just a rebound text(my mom told me she recent broke up with a 2yr relationship). Well she isnt doing to well either and she tries to kill herself so I call out of work for a whole week and I am across the whole country the next day to see her in the hospital. She is finally released and we have an amazing week together! Doing everything, always laughing and just enjoying eachothers company. But theres an issue, she constantly lied to me, about stupid stuff. She is a terrible liar but I never called her out. Even her mom told me she was sleeping with multiple people and when I asked she lied about her previous relationship even though she brought that up. There were so many red flags that I ignored, so many times she made herself to he victim to everything and I knew was trying to get me to feel sorry for her, and I ignored them all because I wanted to support her. On the last night we are snuggled up in her bed as we did everynight and she keeps pulling me on top of her to just \"get closer\" as she says (yeah okay). We start kissing and I ask over and over if its what she wants (i dont want to have sex but i wanted her to be happy and she seemed to really want to) and you can guess what happened. Well I drive home that night and cry all the way home because I know I was just used.  [linebreak]  [linebreak] Over the next couple weeks she slowly talks to me less and less and barely wants to see me after I move back home after almost 10 years away. I finally call her and confront her and she tells me nothing has changed and hasnt talked to me since.  [linebreak]  [linebreak] I am so disgusted with myself for being so easy and ignoring all the signs that she was manipualting me. I cant even look at her because she isnt even the same person she used to be and it hurts so much. Not a single apology or an attempt to say anything from her. I dont know why she used me and I am so broken up about it. I told her all the shit that went down even about me losing my daughter that year (2018) and she still did this. Idk what to do. I want peace but she wont talk to me anymore.  [linebreak]  [linebreak] P.S. There were so many more flags and signs i ignored from family and friends but this post is long enough. [linebreak]  [linebreak] TL;DR:  My best friend/sweet heart from child hood called me up after 10 years. She was struggling so I went to help her out. My time with her was great but there were alot of red flags I ignored. I didnt want to sleep with her but she kept pushing so I did then she started to distance herself from me. I feel so used and disgusted with myself and I dont know why she did it.",

[linebreak]  [linebreak] I appreciate the kind thought and I don't believe you meant to get me going, but you got me going. [linebreak]  [linebreak] How stupid do you think I am?

[linebreak]  [linebreak] It's nice to know that you care about other suicidal people, but for me, I don't take too kindly to being told that I don't have the right to commit suicide.

[linebreak]  [linebreak] Why is it that when I get to be a little too lonely and desperate, the *first* thing you're going to tell me is \"Get help.\"?

My doctor thinks it's amazing that my symptoms would persist for so long without showing signs of being bipolar.  He also thinks it's amazing I'm able to function as well as I do in spite of how bad my depression is. But anyway we have spent the last two years trying different medications. Clearly none of them have worked. At this point we are running out of medications to try, and I'm not optimistic we will find the golden ticket in the handful of antidepressants that remain. I'm doubtful that I will ever get to feel normal again. I have also heard that depression isn't something you ever cure, it's something you learn to live with. Living with it is just code for incurable. If what I heard is right then everyone with depression doesn't get to feel normal again. I have to post this on the subreddit because I don't want to bother anyone with my problems. I'm not worth their time or effort. I just needed to tell someone.",

[linebreak]  [linebreak] I do not like the current fad of releasing remakes and remasters of everything, especially in Nintendo consoles. Additionally, I am not a fan of Nintendo's practices of charging double the price for ports than you see on other consoles (Skyrim costs twice as much on the Switch than on the PS4/XBOX, the new Final Fantasy ports are apparently all at least 40€). [linebreak]  [linebreak] I am certainly not the only person who thinks this, because it is not the first time I see threads and comments being showered with replies that can be summed up to 'shut up and accept it' and flurries of downvotes. [linebreak]  [linebreak] Some of us do not need to relive our childhood, teenagehood or whatever with constant remakes or remasters. Some of us would like new original content or sequels. But since most people keep buying these, companies have realized they can have more profit with half the work by remaking, remastering and re-releasing these games with special edition instead of focusing on other, different projects. This is what gives us stuff like Pokémon Let's Go, which were considered very lackluster remakes with less effort put in them than the remakes that were released over ten years before and what also makes us buy games that are no more than beta versions, since DLC/complete versions come out the year later. [linebreak]  [linebreak] I am not trying to attack eventual posters that identify with this mindset I am disagreeing with. There are remakes/remasters that are really good to introduce a new generation to a certain game (Pokémon Fire Red/Leaf Green, The 3DS Zelda remasters), but there is a growing trend of remakes/remasters/complete edtions that are basically just to profit as much as they can off one game without altering it much. And that is what some of us want to voice their disapproval over, but can't because the downvote brigade rains down on dissent. I had to unsubcribe from r/nintendoswitch because of this, the hivemind is just plain insufferable.",

        "comment": "During the GFC the big four central banks - The Federal Reserve, The ECB (Europe), BOJ (Japan) and PBoC (China) began the process of quantitative easing which is ultimately just printing money but instead of just printing money and giving it out to everyone to spend they directed all the money into the banking system which was then used to loan out at extremely cheap prices for people to buy assets. This is why we have an \"everything bubble\" right now. And why real estate values in many cities have gone extremely high.  [linebreak]  [linebreak] Last year the big four central banks stopped this money printing process and started raising interest rates which caused global asset markets to start crashing as the banks no longer had endless money to lend out they had to \"tighten lending standards\". In Canada they said it was the new \"mortgage stress test laws\", in the UK they said it was \"brexit uncertainty\", in Australia they said it was \"the royal commission into the banks\", and in the US they said it was a mix of Fed rate hikes and US-China trade talks. All these events across the globe conveniently had the same impact at the same time in their respective countries which just so happened to occur when the central banks ended Quantitative Easing (money printing).  [linebreak]  [linebreak] It looked like everything was crashing up until December 2018 however come January global asset markets suddenly revived. That's because the Chinese central bank (PBoC) started printing billions of dollars again: https://www.google.com.au/amp/s/www.cnbc.com/amp/2019/01/16/chinas-central-bank-injects-record-amount-to-stimulate-economy.html [linebreak]  [linebreak] However the central banks have a problem and that is the Modern Monetary Theory movement:   [linebreak] https://www.google.com.au/amp/s/www.bloomberg.com/amp/opinion/articles/2019-01-17/modern-monetary-theory-would-sink-u-s-in-debt [linebreak]  [linebreak] The lower classes have woken up to all this endless money being printed to prop up the assets of the elite and now want a piece of the pie. They are saying \"if you can print endless money to inflate stock markets and real estate you can print endless money to pay for healthcare and infrastructure\". The central banking cartel cannot have this for obvious reasons. It is at that moment where the global financial markets will crash and WW3 will begin in order to create a distraction as to the instability caused by the central banking system.  [linebreak]  [linebreak] We are not at that point just yet as the Central Banks are still able to perform QE without question from the MSM but when it becomes obvious to the masses that this is simply printing money to prop up asset markets and should be used for social services and middle class citizens struggling with mortgage repayments this is when the MSM will draw attention to how unsustainable QE is and it will all end in a devastating debt driven crash.

Even though C lives with just one other dude, her girlfriend is practically her third roommate, and I know this pisses off C's actual roommate. C's girlfriend doesn't go to college and just lives in the same town we go to school in. [linebreak]  [linebreak] C has just gradually stopped talking to me. She even killed our ~600 day snapchat streak a few months ago for practically no reason. Sometimes she'll randomly send me a meme or two on Facebook and I'll try to start a conversation with her, but 95% of the time the conversation ends with her leaving me on read. [linebreak]  [linebreak] Sometimes, I'll see C's other friends around on campus and they'll ask me if I've ever heard from C, because they haven't. Because of this I know this isn't something C's just doing to me, but she's doing this to all her friends. [linebreak]  [linebreak] I'm happy that C is happy in her relationship, but I'm hurt that she's practically cut off myself and all of her other friends. Since I'm graduating in a few months, I want to spend as much time with all of my friends as possible before I leave campus. I haven't seen her in months, and I'm worried that if she doesn't get her shit together, I may not see her again before I graduate [linebreak]  [linebreak] **Thanks for reading.

        "comment": "Background: 21 years old, chubby, friendless, haven't kissed a girl or even held her hand yet. I feel like I've missed out on a lot of things I should've had experienced by now & that it's probably too late to catch up. [linebreak]  [linebreak] Every day is as boring as the previous one. If someone was looking at me all day, all they would see would be some fat guy sitting in front of a gigantic screen with a poker face. [linebreak]  [linebreak] It's sad, man. Every year I feel like it's too late to change, only to regret not having tried one year later. I wish I could go back in time and tell 17 years old me that no, it's not too late to get in shape, as you'll still wish to be ripped when you're 21. Or go back and tell 18 years old me that it is too early to give up any hopes of ever kissing a girl or having a social life. The list goes on. But sadly, I can't change my past. [linebreak]  [linebreak] What's even more depressing is that it is pretty much entirely my fault. Yes, I do have overprotective parents, but I should have done something. If only I had told them to fuck off whenever they asked where I was going, with who, and that endless amount of questions they asked (and still ask) me every time I opened the door, my life could have been a lot more different. [linebreak]  [linebreak] Nowadays, I often act against my own interests solely out of fear. For example: some weeks ago, I messaged a girl I had been texting for around a month (I don't know if I like her as a friend & it's just my mind playing tricks on me because of my inexperience or if I actually like her romantically) at around 3 am and since I didn't get an answer half an hour later I decided to pop some sleeping pills and head to bed. [linebreak]  [linebreak] Right after waking up, I saw her reply. She answered 10 minutes after I knocked myself out. Said she was at some club and told me to drop by if I wanted. A few minutes later, she mentioned that she was going to the beach later if I wanted to go. And that she was leaving the town we both were at at a certain hour. [linebreak]  [linebreak] What did I do? I saw the message an hour before she said she would leave (in the notification panel with my phone in flight mode so she wouldn't know I saw it) and answered an hour after she left with some crappy excuse as to why I couldn't answer earlier. Even though I really wanted to see her. [linebreak]  [linebreak] My lack of social skills angers me. I know I would've done the exact same thing if I hadn't gone to bed before her reply. Why? Because I fear that my awkwardness would drive her away. Especially at a nightclub (only went three times to one, none of them were 'successful' nights at all). The beach was also a terrifying idea because in addition to having zero social skills, I'm not happy with my body at all. [linebreak]  [linebreak] It's not that I'm an introvert. Socializing tends to make me happier and more energetic for the rest of the day. It kills me when I find something funny on the internet and I have no one to share it with. Or when I want to go to the movies or something and I have no one to go with. I dislike being by myself most of the time. I'd love to have a group of friends to go out and have fun with. Or even go on vacations with, like some do. But since I tend to bore people on one-on-one conversations and I usually get kind of ignored when in a group, it looks like an unattainable goal. And I'd love to go to nightclubs, but I don't have the social skills to really enjoy it. [linebreak]  [linebreak] I've recently tried to lose weight again, successfully. Lost 6% bodyfat but I 'gave up' again two weeks ago. I'm struggling once again with the false belief that it's too late to improve. That the door has already closed. The same dumb questions arise: \"Why would I want to be ripped at 22? Will I even be able to catch up with social skills? Will it even be worth it?\". [linebreak]  [linebreak] Any advice is welcome.",

[linebreak]  [linebreak] Mr. Rogers taught us to love one another in spite of differences. The man so hated television that he changed it by himself through his program. I feel that we as the children who grew up on his show have failed him and his memory by dividing ourselves. America is so divided these days that people are faking hate crimes and it is believable to an extent.  I think that we as his former audience need to remember the tolerance he preached. [linebreak]  [linebreak] His message of Everyone is Special is often derided as being unrralistic as \"if everyone is special then no one is.\" But that isnt what Everyone is Special means. It means that we are all deserving of anothers love for what makes us unique. Yes there are bad people out there. Im not denying that, but I think we all need to take a step back, and rather than fight over our differences, bond over our similarities.

YouTube confirmed that, contrary to press reports, it hasn't seen any evidence of videos showing or promoting the \"Momo challenge\" on its platform. If the videos did exist, a spokesperson for YouTube said, they would be removed instantly for violating the platform's policies. Additionally, there have been zero corroborated reports of any child ever taking his or her own life after participating in this phony challenge. [linebreak]  [linebreak]  [linebreak] All of these challenges and trends follow the same formula: A local news station runs a piece overstating a dangerous teen trend. Concerned parents flock to social media to spread the word. Actual teenagers and anyone else who lives their life Extremely Online mock them for their naïveté. Brands and influencers hop on the trend, parodying it and exploiting it for their own gain. And trolls take advantage of those who believe it's real, often by creating and posting content that seemingly confirms parents' worst fears. SNL brilliantly parodied this cycle in 2010. Since then, it has only gotten worse. [linebreak]  [linebreak]  [linebreak] Worried parents share these hoax stories relentlessly on Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram. They beg the platforms themselves to do something to fix the mess. Many parents believe that spreading awareness about the latest dangerous craze will help kids stay safe, but they could very well be doing the opposite. [linebreak]  [linebreak]  [linebreak] The problem is, these stories are only ever a distraction. They offer false reassurance and an easy fix to the wrong problem. If you can protect your child from the Momo challenge, the thinking goes, you can protect them from bad things on the internet. Unfortunately, maintaining kids' safety online is a much more complicated and delicate task. \"This whole 'Momo is making kids commit suicide' is a digital version of playing Beatles records backwards to hear Satanic messages,\" says Ben Collins, a journalist who covers misinformation. \"It does a real disservice to all the harmful stuff targeting children and teens on YouTube.\" [linebreak]",

This denomination of Christianity is extremely strict. Most of the women only wear skirts below the knee, the children are homeschooled, and they reject modern music and media. The Duggar family had a reality television show called \\*19 Kids and Counting\\*, which ended due to backlash when it was discovered that the oldest son molested four of the sisters. A new show, called \\*Counting On\\*, focuses on just the adult children and their lives after the scandal. Both of the TV shows used to have their own subreddits, but they became mostly inactive.

[linebreak]  [linebreak] She always asks if I have crushes on any of my male friends. Asks if I feel anything for them. If there's something between us. I don't understand why. She's not joking. She's being completely serious. It just makes me uncomfortable. And always makes comments about my boyfriend finding someone else to be with at work or at college. [linebreak]  [linebreak] As I was showing her my prom dress, she said, [linebreak]  [linebreak] Maybe you'll get to wear it in college, some guy might invite you out to a fancy event! [linebreak]  [linebreak] I'm going to prom with my boyfriend and I have never been more exited to go to a school event. I've never gone to school dances, events, anything. But my boyfriend wanted to share a special day with me, and that's what my mom had to say about it.  [linebreak]  [linebreak] I wish she could recognize that I'm happy with him, and even though I know it may not last forever, I can hope it will and appreciate the present.

I have argued that there is no observational evidence for global-warming alarm: rather, all claims of such evidence rely on invalid statistical analyses. [linebreak]  [linebreak] Some people, though, assert that the statistical analyses are valid. Those people assert, in particular, that they can determine, via statistical analysis, whether global temperatures have been increasing more than would be reasonably expected by random natural variation. Those people do not present any counter to my argument, but they make their assertions anyway. [linebreak]  [linebreak] In response to that, I am sponsoring a contest: the prize is $100 000. Anyone who can demonstrate, via statistical analysis, that the increase in global temperatures is probably not due to random natural variation should be able to win the contest. [linebreak]  [linebreak]  [linebreak]  [linebreak]  [linebreak] A time series is any series of measurements taken at regular time intervals. Examples include the following: prices on the New York Stock Exchange at the close of each business day; the total rainfall in England each month; the total wheat harvest in Canada each year. Another example is the average global temperature each year. [linebreak]  [linebreak] Most data sets used in the study of climate are time series. Yet there are almost no climate scientists that have competence in the statistical analysis of time series. [linebreak]  [linebreak] Statistical incompetence has misled climate scientists into believing that they can distinguish between purely random series and series generated with a trend. The purpose of the Contest is to show that such a belief is false, at least for the series of global temperatures.

[linebreak]  [linebreak] My story is a little different though, and I felt like I have to share and hear other people's' inputs. [linebreak]  [linebreak] So my story begins with me having *ahem* intimate relations with my loving girlfriend. Nothing interesting or out of the ordinary there. We were maybe a little louder than normal because no one else was home, but otherwise a standard occurrence. Afterwards, we're both starving and decided we wanted to order a pizza.  [linebreak]  [linebreak] So I grab my phone and click the url to highlight, and my keyword suggestions are \"Ego-dynastic Sexual Orientation\" and \"Sexual Intercourse.\" And what's particularly odd about that is it wasn't a Safari suggestion (I have an iPhone 8), but an actual keyword suggestion on my keyboard. Trying to replicate that wasn't easy, and I had to search the former and take a screenshot of those suggestions to give an idea of what I saw. [linebreak]  [linebreak] Regardless,  it's very possible that something similar has happened to me before, but the fact that I wasn't even really talking about anything sexual other than moaning, and my phone making suggestions for what it did seems eerily similar to what people describe in their experiences with those Facebook ads.

I was stuck in a downward spiral of self pity and loathing and it only made my condition worse. [linebreak]  [linebreak] Something clicked  a couple months ago. I think i realized what i was doing- i had pushed away so many loving individuals while gaining weight and playing too many videogames. I figured that the only person who could help me get out of this loop was myself. I decided i would eat better, go to the gym, and reconnect with those i pushed away. [linebreak]  [linebreak] Back to the pull up- with the help of some buddies i started exercising regularly. When i started, i absolutely hated it.

[linebreak]  [linebreak] Im really proud of myself for this. Im still a chubby dude (5 foot 8 in, 165 lbs), but its so cool to see myself improve.

[linebreak]  [linebreak] Its not like ive eliminated all my flaws. I still stress eat and sleep too little. I still occasionally try too hard to be the funniest person in the room, and project myself onto others. But its baby steps, ya feel? Slowly but surely, im improving myself! [linebreak]  [linebreak] Its just a fucking pull up but it really means so much more to me. It really feels like ive succeeded at something for the first time in forever. Its the first step towards feeling happy, and normal.

        "comment": "I think the idea of duality explains the nature of freemasonry very well. We've all heard stories about freemasons being involved in a lot of conspiracies and the like so I studied a little and I've met quite a few low level masons myself. Even thought they deny it, they have a tendency for the occult and of keeping secrets, but overall freemasonry teaches them a lot of good things. A popular myth is that Lucifer is the god of freemasonry, which is true, their version of Lucifer is that of a benevolent being who represents knowledge and truth and they believe a true mason must constantly seek knowledge for the sake of others. The same thing can't be said about the high ranking masons, who worship a lot of wicked deities. [linebreak]  [linebreak] A good example of those high ranking masons could be the British royal family, like Prince William and Queen Elizabeth, because a lot of members of that family are 32-33 degree masons, the Rothschilds themselves have married with the British royals and they have married with a lot of the European noble families over time, like [the Aldobrandini family, which is part of the Italian/black nobility families.](https://saidit.net/s/conspiracy/comments/arg/the_italianblack_nobility_families/) So their wealth has grown over time. The Rothschilds were involved in [grooming Clinton for presidency months before she launched her candidacy.](https://thefreethoughtproject.com/wikileaks-rothschilds-clinton-presidency/) and they also [bailed out Trump when he almost broke his father's business](https://saidit.net/s/conspiracy/comments/79z/some_background_on_how_trump_almost_broke_his/) so they've been involved with a lot of politicians and It's safe to say a lot of those nobles I mentioned before are involved in the whole mess too. [linebreak]  [linebreak] So you see, both the stories about freemasonry being a friendly fraternity with slight occult leanings and the ones of the masons being dark occultist being involved in conspiracies are true simultaneously. That's why I consider freemasonry to be a secret society despite the fact that a lot of masons like to sell themselves as being part of an \"open society\". Keeping secrets is common for even the low level members and the high level members are involved in a lot of corrupt things. [linebreak]  [linebreak] What interesting facts do you know about freemasonry and other secret societies?",

I don't want anyone to be a casualty of my emotions. [linebreak]  [linebreak] My guy is very supportive; he tries to be. He's fairly critical of some things and strongly opinionated. These are things I love about him.

I feel like I'm burdening him with my emotional distress, and that maybe I articulate poorly. [linebreak]  [linebreak] So i do. I say everything is fine.

Jesuit priests promote the normalization of the LGBT by referring to parts of the bible that deals with accepting all people.

I then had another account suspended the very next day, brand new account for the same trumped up \"ban evasion\" bs, I've submitted appeals on every account and emailed as well as contacting the r/modsupport mod mail.   [linebreak]  [linebreak] Anyway, one of the subs I used to moderate was r/snp which is the subreddit of the Scottish national party, of which I am a member. This is the current party in power in the Scottish parliament whose ultimate goal is Scottish independence. I've come to learn that u/dougal83 is actually a mod and supporter of r/UKIPparty. This would be like someone modding r/the_donald and r/the_mueller, or r/liberalism and r/conservative.  [linebreak]  [linebreak] I messaged the modmail to get re added and was told that Dougal has no intention of re adding me unless a Reddit \"moderator\" (admin) messages them telling them it was in error. Now everyone knows Reddit admins A) don't discuss actions taken on other users accounts, and B) would never do that. [linebreak]  [linebreak] After calling out the inaccuracy of that statement, I was [muted](https://imgur.com/a/GfgSgmz) [linebreak]  [linebreak] Now this is a small subreddit so not being able to mod it isn't the end of the world as I attend my local branch's meetings consistently and pay dues. But it's a bit rich that people are playing both sides. Note when I was first added as a moderator back in october, I simply messaged the mod mail and was added with no questions asked or even a response to the mod mail. Just a simple invitation.

[linebreak]  [linebreak] **I propose that once upon a time Reddits subreddits were about discussing a subject.** [linebreak]  [linebreak] So /r/Food would be about discussing food. /r/News about discussing News. [linebreak] The same way even the political and other more divisive subreddits were about the subject itself. [linebreak]  [linebreak] Even if /r/Socialism was run by a socialist and /r/Capitalism by a capitalist the purpose was not to create a community of socialists or capitalists but discuss the subjects, events and happenings concerning them. [linebreak]  [linebreak] Today almost no sub is about about discussing it **but being part of it, being supportive of it, being loyal to it.** [linebreak] (Exceptions for like \"True, or Truetrue subs). [linebreak]  [linebreak] This is why TD bans even supporters of **Donald Trump** when critically analyzing the presidents actions in say his ever more hawkish appointments.  [linebreak]  [linebreak] Or why various socialist subs ban outright **socialist members** for lifting the issue in Venezuela from a critical point of view. [linebreak]  [linebreak] Or even why the mods in /r/Food will ban you for criticizing someones food, or notion of food or beauty or taste of food.  [linebreak]  [linebreak] The concept of what a sub is about has changed. Or rather what a sub is *for*. Subreddits are no longer divisions of topics but divided communities.  [linebreak]  [linebreak] I remember on one of my older accounts one of my first banishments was in a subreddit for something literally called \"/r/soylent\" (from the movie Soylent Green) and rebranded as something positive. I was absolutely downvoted and then banished after a prolonged discussion (with little give and take) and I've seen this mannerism now spread to all sectors of Reddit.  [linebreak]  [linebreak] We either need to change this very fundamental of perception in ourselves or we must accept that even completely benign and neutral subreddits like say /r/News or your local subreddit will be taken over by a particular group and that group will congregate around their definition of the subject and then proceed to isolate voices that do not adhere to that as it progresses to define itself, whether openly or subconsciously.  [linebreak]  [linebreak]  [linebreak] We must rethink what we use reddit for or concede that this is the future. [linebreak]  [linebreak]  [linebreak]  [linebreak]  [linebreak] ____ [linebreak]  [linebreak]  [linebreak] A way to stop this would be to change a fundamental concept of Reddit. To forbid subreddits from having selective enforcing based on any stance on any one issue.  [linebreak]  [linebreak] So you could talk as much shit about socialism as you wanted in a socialist sub as you could talk shit about capitalism in a capitalist sub as long as you followed the rest of the subs rules.  [linebreak]  [linebreak] I honestly think that it's either this or we might as well shut up about it, because organic change might not come about as all the subs are now protecting themselves against brigading and \"concern trolling\" and other such things the same way an arms race in real life functions. So either make them all bend the knee or the struggle is pointless. But at least we can come to a common understanding of why it is happening, hence this thread. This way we can also stop acting out as victims of a particular ideology, religion, sex, location, interest or what ever when we get banned.  We are victims of one side of Reddit, nothing else, sadly.",

        "comment": "u/Elainepaige123 So I had started talking to this guy about five months ago, that liked me back in high school. Im now 20 and he's 21. It started out as texting and then we started hanging out. At first I had made it clear that I only wanted to be friends. I really liked him, but my Christian parents did not allow me to date him, because he is an atheist. I am completely undecided as far as religion goes and still trying to figure things out, but at the time I was just going to school and was completely dependent on my parents financially and had to follow their rules. [linebreak]  [linebreak] My parents allowed me to hang out with him as long as nothing more happened, but then eventually things escalated to the point where we were making out, so I called it all off in order to make sure that nothing went further than I was comfortable with at the moment, as things were moving very quickly, but mostly because my mother found out and didn't allow me to contact him anymore. I sent him a message and explained everything about my parents and how I wasn't allowed to see him. He texted me two weeks later and says he just misses talking to me so we started talking again secretly over text messages. Before long I am sneaking out and going to see him again until eventually he told me that he loved me and that we should move in together as soon as he started his new job. [linebreak]  [linebreak] He said that he wanted to help me get out of my parents house, as they are extremely controlling and he hated them for it. He was in the process of getting a new job and said when he got his first paycheck we'd get an apartment together, as I was also starting a new job. He was telling me that he had never met anyone like me and that he didn't want to lose me. He also said that I was his best friend, which is when I fell hard, because I've never had a best friend. eventually I was sending nudes, as we rarely got to see each other and we were sexting and we were even making plans financially and he seemed super sincere. [linebreak]  [linebreak] He got the job that he had been wanting and we were so happy. The next day I lost my virginity to him and two days later he texts me and says I'm too nice for him and that he doesn't love me anymore. He told me we should both be single and that he was distracting me from nursing school. He also told me that he was a bad guy and that i could do better. [linebreak]  [linebreak] I asked for a better explanation, but he said, \" listen to me! You can just be a friend I'm at work now!\" Later I told him that I had to block him and wouldn't be able to speak to him again and he said, \"alrighty.\". I asked him why he was being so cold and he said it wasn't cool of me to block him. I explained it was because of my parents and he said he was sorry and that he understood. [linebreak]  [linebreak] That's the last I heard from him. Did he ever love me or did I just get played? Is it possible that he faked a whole 5 month relationship? Could he have lied about everything he said about me? [linebreak]  [linebreak] or was he for real about his reasons? It was all so sudden and he hasn't spoken to me since, as my parents found out that I was sneaking out and forced me to block him and put a tracker app on my phone so that they know everywhere that I go. I'm so confused. I still love him and he said he wanted friends, but now I can't speak to home at all. [linebreak]  [linebreak] I want closure, but don't know how to get it. I was honestly turning into a nervous wreck, because of the situation with my parents. All of the lies and lack of freedoms was getting to me and I wasn't okay. He kept telling me I looked \"devastated\" the last time I saw him. I was not mentally well, because I felt like I was morally wrong. I used to send him long messages every so often explaining my emotions and then regret it later, but he said he was okay with it. I wonder if that is why he left. I feel so embarrassed for opening up to him, as I am usually a shy person. [linebreak]  [linebreak] TL;DR guy that I fell in love with says he loves me, then dumps me after taking my virginity. Haven't heard from him since.",

[linebreak]  [linebreak] Based on my own personal experience and other posts I've seen, I would argue there is a real problem with people attacking the OP for venting views they do not like. I get this isn't a safe space for any specific groups and I'm not saying people can't disagree with what someone is venting about. I've gotten into it quite a bit with some people's venting here, like them hating an entire group of people because of the actions of a few. However, far too often do I notice people resort to personal attacks, aka ad hominem fallacy. Not to mention this violates rule 4 of this sub. I suspect the reason this rule is in place is to stop this sort of thing. Attack the argument, not the person. [linebreak]  [linebreak] Basically, instead of people addressing why they disagree with what someone is venting about, they often try to discredit the person by making claims like \"you're not really X\" or \"you're fake and a troll\". That's not to say trolling doesn't happen here, but often, disagreeing with someone's venting is treated as if that person is just trying to get a rise out of people. It's like people refuse to believe someone could have unpopular opinions and stand by them, no, they *must* be trolling. It's very closed minded too, because the person making the troll claim refuses to think outside of their world view. For example, if you're a racial minority, some people have a hard time believing you if you don't fall into stereotypical views for your race. Is it so hard to believe someone can have opinions you don't like and that they believe in them? If they really are trolling, you replying to them just fuels their fire. It's so unproductive to vent if all people are going to do is accuse you of being this or not being that, effectively going against the purpose of this sub. [linebreak]  [linebreak] Given that the purpose of this sub is to allow opinions and venting that OffMyChest wouldn't allow, I would expect better of people here. I dare say if you want a sub like this where people get auto banned from posting in specific subs that OffMyChest mods don't like, that sub is much more of a fit for you than hanging around here trying to dogpile people who go against your world views. [linebreak]  [linebreak] So, disagree with me on this if you must, but I think it would be better to debunk my arguments rather than claim I'm a fake and thus, that alone is somehow supposed to invalidate everything I've written.",

[linebreak]  [linebreak] A common argument is that the rates for allergies, Alzheimer's, cancer, etc. are rising, just as vaccination rates. Many people draw the conclusion that there is causation between the two. Come on lads, we learned this early on. **Correlation does NOT equal causation.**  [linebreak]  [linebreak] Allergy rates and cancer rates and autoimmune disorder rates all that jazz are rising. Well no shit, Sherlock. The population is increasing rapidly, and the people genetically predisposed to these conditions reproduce and create more who are genetically predisposed. [linebreak]  [linebreak] Take 4 people. 2 men, 2 women. 3 have to predisposition to Alzheimer's, 1 does. Each man has children with one of the women. The man who has a predisposition to Alzheimer's passes it on to 2 kids, say both men. The couple without it doesn't pass it on (obviously) to their, say, 2 girls. Now half the population has it. Again, they pair up, and both men pass on the predisposition to the future generation, and now the whole population has it. [linebreak]  [linebreak] Obviously this is a *much* smaller scale, but it's comparable to our current world's situation. If you think the increase of rates for certain things is anything but mathematics and genetics, you're living a lie. One person with a random gene mutation passed that on to multiple people, and those people passed it on to multiple people, and now we're here. Exponential rates can start out increasing in tiny increments, but then get to the billions in the blink of an eye.

I am now currently a sophomore year going into junior year. [linebreak]  [linebreak] I grew up with engineering drilled into my brain. My dad is an engineer, and as a little kid I always solve problems, create new objects with lego pieces, and always wondered how cars work. I excelled in many math and science tests until starting middle school when I moved into a bit more average. [linebreak]  [linebreak] I then entered a top tier engineering school under an engineering program. I quickly realized how much I hated chemistry and barely scrapped by with a D in both Calculus 3 (Taylor series, sequences, etc...) and chemistry II, got into academic probation. I then switched into another form of engineering, bumped my GPA up with easy classes just to get out of academic probation, then got into academic probation again after failing Statics with a F. I honestly feel very annoyed. [linebreak]  [linebreak] I'm now sitting in my house during spring break thinking Engineering isn't right for me. I literally have no drive to do well in classes anymore. I hate going back to school, rather irritated each time I have to go back. I hate the constant going to class, sitting in there listening to pointless bullshit, then getting out. I hate the constant homework that is being thrown at me. The thing I hate most? Tests. Why do we have to memorize all of pointless math and others? I don't know which other major I can be interested at. [linebreak]  [linebreak] Most people I'm around with are rather shitty, or I just don't fit in with them. I am losing multiple friends back in home, and I'm not making any true friends in college.

I always have nothing to do rather than playing video games instead of seeing all other people going to college parties with their super close group of friends. I also got made fun of for driving a manual transmission vehicle that I bought, because it was cheap and reliable, but at least I have a freaking car to use, right?

I've been noticing I got angry a lot easier, especially after getting back test scores when all I want to do is to yell \"FUCK ENGINEERING\" in my brain. Why can't I just get my shit together? I hate being one of the least smartest students in class, but I loathe almost every single math and science courses I take. I loathe calculus and linear analysis. I loathe all physics, chemistry, and biology. Why did I let GPA dictate my happiness? And otherwise, why the hell do most jobs have this 3.0 GPA minimum required? It's a very stupid requirement to have, just seeing all those people who cheated their way being eligible for that job. [linebreak]  [linebreak] Feel free to ask me any more questions.",

        "comment": "## Take 1: Autonomous vehicles will kill transit / will change transit so profoundly that we might as well stop building transit and wait for them to rescue us. [linebreak]  [linebreak] We build transit for many reasons, but the *chief* reason is to move as many people as possible using as few resources as possible: this, in turn, makes commuting cheaper, and frees up certain resources (like road space, parking spaces, fuel, etc.) to relieve pressure on commuters who make other choices. This also helps make our cities work better: more transit, less traffic, more commerce, fewer accidents, fewer person-hours spent sitting in traffic, easier for law enforcement and emergency vehicles, ancillary benefits (better for the environment, conserve manufacturing resources, get around the city without a car...), everybody's a winner. [linebreak]  [linebreak] And autonomous vehicles have absolutely nothing to do with that. Look at it like this: [linebreak]  [linebreak] How many subway trains does it take to move 1000 commuters? 1. [linebreak]  [linebreak] How many light rail vehicles does it take to move 1000 commuters? 5. [linebreak]  [linebreak] How many double-decker buses does it take to move 1000 commuters? 13. [linebreak]  [linebreak] How many standard buses does it take to move 1000 commuters? 20. [linebreak]  [linebreak] How many private cars does it take to move 1000 commuters? In the United States, about 650. (As of 2018, most rush-hour private vehicles carried about 1.54 occupants.) [linebreak]  [linebreak] And how many autonomous private cars does it take to move 1000 commuters? About 650. [linebreak]  [linebreak] Which is to say, in any city large enough to support higher-order transit, *when it comes to the key reason we build transit*, transit will always beat autonomous vehicles. [linebreak]  [linebreak] When it comes to other situations -- rural areas, small towns, places where there simply isn't enough demand even to sustain a basic bus service -- autonomous vehicles will be a major boon. But in the big cities, the fundamentals for transit will remain strong. [linebreak]  [linebreak] ---- [linebreak]  [linebreak] ## Take 2: Transit agencies in Asia can turn a profit, so European and North American agencies should be able to do so as well. [linebreak]  [linebreak] Insofar as transit agencies in Asia turn a profit, they normally do so on their property holdings: they own the land above their stations, which gets turned into skyscrapers, which means dollars in their pockets. But this also means that these transit agencies aren't turning a profit *as transit agencies*. [linebreak]  [linebreak] I have a friend who plays the trombone. She makes $100,000 a year, which is a *lot* of money for a trombone player. Of course, she makes that money by working as a *lawyer*. Should we therefore go around to every trombone player and tell them off for not earning six figures? [linebreak]  [linebreak] ---- [linebreak]  [linebreak] ## Take 3: Free transit would solve a lot of problems. [linebreak]  [linebreak] Free transit is a great solution for smaller communities, especially in cases where the agency spends more money collecting fares than it receives in fares. (After all, fares don't just get deposited in the farebox: someone has to count them, someone has to print and issue tickets, someone has to draw up reports, someone has to do bank runs, the agency needs a secure room to hold the money and fare equipment, fareboxes themselves aren't free... if you spend $100,000 per year on collecting/counting/depositing/handling fares, but only make $50,000 in the farebox, you're a prime candidate for getting rid of them.) [linebreak]  [linebreak] Free transit is also a fine solution if you want to address specific social needs or social problems. For example, a growing number of agencies offer free services on New Year's night, and many also offer free services to and from major public events where drinking is commonplace. You might also offer free services between seniors' homes and shopping centres, or between campuses of a hospital or university. Makes a lot of sense. [linebreak]  [linebreak] But studies consistently show that free transit does more harm than good in larger communities as a general service. Specifically, free transit: [linebreak]  [linebreak] 1. Causes driver morale to plummet. [linebreak] 2. Causes vandalism to skyrocket, which significantly increases maintenance costs and can also cause vehicle shortages. (If you're pulling 8 buses out of service due to vandalism every day, but you're only able to return 4 to service on an average day, you've got a bad problem.) [linebreak] 3. Turns vehicles into homeless shelters on wheels. [linebreak] 4. Attracts hooligans. (They can basically do whatever they want on the bus, and even if someone eventually forces them off... they can hop right on the next one.) [linebreak] 5. As a result of points 2, 3 and 4, free transit discourages \"choice\" ridership, and can actually increase the number of cars on the road. (If they don't feel safe and comfortable taking transit, people who can afford to drive instead will start choosing to do so.) [linebreak] 6. Significantly increases law enforcement callouts, partly because it significantly increases assaults on drivers. [linebreak]  [linebreak] Bottom line, it tends to do more harm than good. Even just charging a small fare (50 cents or the like) does a significant amount to deter these behaviours. Covering the farebox just unleashes it. [linebreak]  [linebreak] ---- [linebreak]  [linebreak] ## Take 4: My city has terrible transit. It's so much better in [x]. [linebreak]  [linebreak] You think transit's better in New York, London, Paris, Chicago, San Francisco, Vancouver, Toronto, Berlin, Sydney, whatever? [linebreak]  [linebreak] Maybe it is: these cities do have more options and modes of transit than your average city. But go to that city's subreddit and I guarantee you'll see the same gripes and problems as your city: bus bunching, cancelled services, short-turns, confusing maps, disinterested drivers, etc. [linebreak]  [linebreak] Don't confuse your three-day sojourn in, say, Portland (during which you never travelled in rush hour, only visited downtown destinations, and took the streetcar just because you *could*...) for the reality of what people who actually live in that city put up with every day. If you had to commute from the suburbs to downtown, making two connections and consistently missing your bus, you would feel differently: in fact, you'd feel similarly to how you probably feel about your hometown's transit agency. You have my condolences for the inconvenience, but you also aren't so special. [linebreak]  [linebreak] ---- [linebreak]  [linebreak] ## Take 5: Here's a cool technology: let's shoehorn it into our system without a rationale. [linebreak]  [linebreak] This goes for: [linebreak]  [linebreak] 1. Aerial tramways [linebreak] 2. Monorails [linebreak] 3. People-movers [linebreak] 4. Personal Rapid Transit [linebreak] 6. [Chinese straddling buses](https://static01.nyt.com/images/2010/08/18/business/global/18bus1/18bus1-jumbo.jpg) [linebreak] 5. River ferries [linebreak] 6. etc. etc. etc. [linebreak]  [linebreak] Many of these technologies are *interesting*, but people tend to obsess over them to the exclusion of more sensible transportation modes. There are *specific situations* where these technologies may make sense (monorails are great for tourists, aerial tramways can move people across bodies of water or up mountainsides, river ferries are great in cities built up around the river, etc.), but simply building them for the sake of building them (someone decides \"hey, aerial tramways are cool, we should build an aerial tramway!\") means your city will dump billions of dollars into acquiring a white elephant. On the plus side, as the only user, you'll be able to take some sweet unobstructed photos! [linebreak]  [linebreak] When it comes to building higher-order transit (like monorails, people-movers, etc.), I've got a simple truism for you. You need one of two things: [linebreak]  [linebreak] 1. A *lot* of cyclical demand, to such an extent that buses can't carry the load. [linebreak] 2. A *lot* of conter-cyclical demand: all-day traffic in all directions, steady demand all day long. Usually this means linking a city centre with an amenity like a large university, a major intermodal transit hub, another city centre, a major shopping centre or district, a major tourist attraction, etc. [linebreak]  [linebreak] If you don't meet either criteria... stick to boring, bunchy, uninspiring buses. Detroit hasn't really profited from investing millions of dollars in a people-mover. Sydney wound up tearing out their monorail after years of disappointing results. New Orleans built an aerial tramway which lasted less than a year in revenue service. Save your money.",

[linebreak] There is someone for everyone.  [linebreak] It's not like you're contiguous. [linebreak]  [linebreak] Just shut up and listen. It's not that simple. It's never that simple.  [linebreak]  [linebreak] Dating the sick girl means committing to non-commitment. Plans will be ruined, or more likely cancelled. Travel is rare or just completely out of the question. Dating the sick girl means put a ton of blood, sweat and tears into someone who might not even have a future. It means a lot of days sitting alone on the couch while she naps in the bedroom. It means being taken care of, even though it feels silly, because she understands how fragile the human body can be and she doesn't want to lose you. Because you mean everything to her. [linebreak]  [linebreak] And she's not a passing fancy, or a charity case. She doesn't want your pity. She is not interested in a fleeting romance. So much of her life is fleeting, over before it starts. She's only interested in a solid lasting connection, it's something that is so very precious to her because the concrete often feels so out of reach for someone who lives with what she does.   [linebreak]  [linebreak] It's hard. It's not easy. It's not always fun.  [linebreak]  [linebreak] And I know what you're thinking: [linebreak]  [linebreak] No relationship is perfect. [linebreak] All relationships have problems. [linebreak]  [linebreak] Shut the fuck up because those problems are pretty fucking small in comparison to what comes with dating a sick girl. You don't get it unless you've lived through it. But even then you don't fucking get it because you're not her. You don't feel what she feels. You don't see all of her pain because she hides it from you, because she cares about you and wants to protect YOU. [linebreak]  [linebreak] And you can't protect her, and it's devastating. You can't protect her, and it makes you feel weak and useless. It starts to eat at you deep down, and it festers there until you can't take it anymore and then you do what seemed unimaginable. [linebreak]  [linebreak] You leave her.  [linebreak]  [linebreak] And her heart breaks as it has every time before. She feels abandoned, alone and lost. She lost her rock. And it kills her inside, because she gets why you left, but she is also so angry because you don't fucking get it.  [linebreak]  [linebreak] All she needed was for you to be her rock. [linebreak] Solid. [linebreak] Concrete. [linebreak]  [linebreak] And now she's left again with no one to lean on. [linebreak]  [linebreak] Because no one wants to date the sick girl.

The information provided is not even substantial enough for any unsolicited advice to even be remotely useful anyway. So if you're feeling the impulse do yourself a favor and keep it to yourself and not make yourself look like an asshole. You're welcome. [linebreak]  [linebreak] This was a rant. An expression of frustration and not meant to be any kind of discussion or condemnation of anyone.  [linebreak]  [linebreak] Honestly it's kind of ridiculous that I have to explain that.",

I can't link names anymore because I don't want to get suspended for mentioning this user *again*, but I had a very high karma thread here removed by the Anti-Evil team that posted a PM conversation between me and [highest karma user] where he outed himself (jocularly or not) as a paid advertiser for companies, etc., and well... [linebreak]  [linebreak] I got suspended for seven days for \"Harassment\". [linebreak]  [linebreak] Today on the **sixth day** it was finally reversed via appeal. My appeal was simple. There is no harassment if someone messages **YOU** and never ONCE indicates in the messages that they wish to stop receiving messages. That very clearly means they WANT to keep talking to you. [linebreak]  [linebreak] Not once did [highest karma user] *ever* indicate he didn't want to receive further messages from me! In fact, the last PM I had sent him was to never contact me again, which he somewhat complied with, well, until he had his cronies (the Reddit admins) falsely suspend me. [linebreak]  [linebreak] Posting private messages (of which he was going to do anyway, evident by how he used it to rally brigades against me and many others) is a bit crass but **not** against the rules whatsoever. [linebreak]  [linebreak] tl;dr: Do **NOT** talk to power users or anyone who may have an agenda against you. Reddit admins don't actually look at harassment reports---they just take them at face value and assume the report is true. An appeal will likely be listened to at some point if you're not being a tool within it and **have clear and concise proof that they not only initiated conversation but never said \"stop talking to me\" or anything to that effect**, but it'll be near the end of the suspension anyway.",

I'm dealing with a lot and through my life have dealt with a lot of things which have caused a lot of emotional trauma.

        "comment": "I'm not sure if this is actually a thing or not but I'm going to break down each of memorable highs. [linebreak]  [linebreak] First time getting high: Grade 10, at lunch time. I couldnt walk, couldnt stand, barely could speak and sat in the woods for little over 4hours. I was generally afraid for my life and was listening to christian music thinking I was going to die. Finally some chick came over and helped me get home which I fellasleep and felt super exhausted when I woke up. [linebreak]  [linebreak] Second big high: Smoked with a lot of friends and played Fortnite, generally felt pretty good. I could only focus on one thing however, but when I focused on it I felt like I could really understand it. We were listening to music and I felt my ears could feel the beat in them (Like the Trap Nation logo in their videos but in my ears). If I rubbed my arms I could feel that same feeling over and over again even though I stopped doing it. Felt like my heart was pumping very fast and I was biting down hard on my teeth. I came to the conclusion that what I'm feeling is from the high, almost like a lucid high (??) Like I was awareness what I was feeling was from a high and I could control my high because I control my brain. If I opened my mouth I could still feel the feeling of my clenching my jaw, if I stopped putting my hand over my heart I could still feel my heart pounding. I could stop and continue effects, almost like I was coding my brain to stop and start whatever I wanted to do. [linebreak]  [linebreak] Last big high and last time smoking (2 weeks ago): 16% thc prerolls I bought at the liquor store, couldnt even finish the whole joint, got half way before I threw it out. I had to find an activity I could do because if I kept to myself I felt like I would get lost in my mind and eventually die. It felt like I was connecting all the dots to life, I had to snap myself out of thinking too much because it made me want to fallasleep and at the time falling asleep = death. I had to keep my mind away of thinking about my high, if I thought about it my heart felt like it would speed up, like a wheel and it would get faster and faster and then eventually it felt like someone was whipping my consicous, I'd think about something and then I'd hear the crack of a whip and the thought would be gone. I felt like my sober self was fighting my high self to see who could keep conscious and it was exhausting. I had to keep throwing out thoughts because I'd spiral farther down and couldnt stop myself. I tried watching Brooklyn 99 but I kep imagining my life as a movie, and what would someones reaction would be to what I was doing right now, then I'd imagine my reaction to me thinking about my life as a movie and the cycle would continue. I tried taking a shower but it felt too good and relaxing, It felt like my legs were telling my brain that they were done standing and going to give out soon. Overall it was like each part of my body was its own body and they all were trying to communicate at the same time. Then I decided to play Fortnite and LoL, first couple of games were rough but then I decided that if I control my brain I'll force myself to get into the perfect state of mind to play, so I did. Just thinking about the right state of mind allowed me to get in it, and I played the best I've ever played in my life.  [linebreak]  [linebreak] What are my theories? I must be triggering some receptor or something in my brain that causes a episode. But I also think that while I'm high I control more of my brain because the thc receptors in my brain is filled up rather than being empty normally (if thats how it works). I generally believe that I can overdose on marijuana, and I want to get my brain checked out while I'm high, I'm fine with being the first person to OD on marijuana if it furthers the research.  [linebreak]  [linebreak] So what do ya'll think? I'm up for any questions.",

I just fucking am I can't help it it's been like this for 5 years but it's been a lot worse recently.

I now know he doesn't care about me, but his still MY best friend. We used to talk everyday, now if he doesn't see me during school hours, he doesn't even send me a message. If I don't look up for him or talk to him, he just ignores me. I have come to think he grew tired of being my friend, as everyone I know. This always happens to me. Nevertheless, I still want his friendship and his approval, even when he has done me so many bad things. Some days it looks as if I'm really his best friend, but other days, he completely ignores my existence. It's just too much. I feel too much, and I always overthink too much.

We were talking for a few days, and then out of the blue she asks to trade nudes. Normally I'm only really into girls, or feminine trans girls, but I said ok. We traded a few back and forth for a bit, and it was kinda nice. Which is confusing to me now because I can't normally stand seeing a dick, much less get off to one, but IDK. That's not the point of my post. Basically, I enjoyed it. But now I'm starting to think she's actually into me romantically. She keeps talking about cuddling, and other cutesy stuff, and she's still being pretty sexually provocative. The problem is, if she is into me, the feeling isn't mutual, and I feel weird about doing anything because it's kind of a lie. I like her, but as a friend. I don't really want to have any kind of digital relationship, be it romantic or sexual, but that seems like what she wants. I don't want to just cut her off, but I don't really know what to do.

        "comment": "We first got the internet in our house in 1998; I was 12. The first website I visited was TheForce.Net; the second was a porn site. I'd already discovered masturbation a year prior but unfettered web access blew the doors off the whole fucking thing. As a shy and introverted kid, who'd been relentlessly teased by girls in middle school and junior high and had learned to fear them, and who was now going to an all boys high school, it was a godsend for my raging, gooey hormones. I didn't have to worry about girls anymore! Everything I knew about naked girls in my teenage years, I learned from the internet. It felt like the perfect — and safe — release valve. It was also a prime enabler of avoidance of girls, and of never needing to confront the reality that not all girls were going to make fun of me. My grades never suffered, and I did have friends, but I was pretty well in the internet porn bubble by 15. [linebreak]  [linebreak] Around then, my porn tastes had expanded from merely jacking to pictures of naked women and low quality video clips to reading erotica. Lots of it. Literotica was a wonderland for me. I also got to indulge my curiosity in gay porn, and I found the sheer novelty of it to be breathtakingly exciting. I mixed it in with all the opposite-sex porn I was consuming I began a long period of questioning my sexuality, even though being surrounded by guys all day, I never felt attracted or infatuated to a single one of them. It never occurred to me at 16 and 17 that I was responding to the novelty and the taboo of watching gay porn, and that it did not align with my own sexual preferences. Soon after I graduated from high school, I decided to put it to the test — I found a guy my age who lived nearby, and I actually lost my virginity to him. It did not do a damn thing for me, and I came away confident that I wasn't gay, but the porn consumption continued.  [linebreak]  [linebreak] I didn't date at all from 17 to 20. I'd had my first girlfriend during high school and it was very exciting in a physical sense, thereby proving that I was still very much attracted to girls, but that had long since ended and I retreated into my shell of depression/anxiety and enough porn to suffocate a lesser man. High speed internet had come into our home, so now there was more porn, and it was *faster!* Now there were streaming sites; Xtube was an early favorite of mine. It was so comforting and reliable, and it never made me feel anxious; ashamed, but never anxious.  [linebreak]  [linebreak] I starting dating my first real girlfriend when I was 20, and she was the first time I'd ever had sex with a woman, and the first time I'd had sex at all since that one guy I'd experimented with. I enjoyed sex with her but was still pretty anxious and inhibited about not living up to the dudes I'd watched in pornos, both professional and amateur. This led to a lot of performance anxiety, and using masturbation as a self-soothing mechanism, it gave rise to erectile dysfunction as well. Erectile dysfunction at 21 years old. Can you fucking believe it? It was a source of tension in the relationship, amongst other things — namely my untreated anxiety and depression, which I didn't want to accept and face. My porn consumption bothered her as well. Long story short, we lasted two years before the entire relationship deteriorated. This did nothing to improve my self-esteem. [linebreak]  [linebreak] Over the next decade, I went on a ton of first dates that went nowhere, and had a handful of one-night stands where I could force myself to perform (at least) adequately. Entire days, nights, and weekends would be consumed by porn — streaming videos, pictures, literary erotica, and once I found Reddit, a ton of the gonewild-type subs. I'd be masturbating four or five times a day when I was alone. It would leave me feeling drained and utterly revolted by myself. My socialization dropped like a rock as a result of intense anxiety, and the excessive masturbation was being used as an avoidance mechanism to hold the anxiety at bay. It was all a terribly dysfunctional cycle.  [linebreak]  [linebreak] A few months ago, the woman of my dreams, whom I'd been dating for over a year, left me for reasons unrelated to my masturbation habits. It broke me, and I'm now finally getting therapy for the anxiety that has held my life in a death grip since adolescence. And now, it's time to leave masturbation behind too. I've masturbated five times in the last twenty-four hours due to obvious anxiety issues and I cannot stand it anymore. I'm feeling disgusted and ashamed of myself for the last time. I'm going to get better, and goddammit I'm going to pursue the type of life and relationships I deserve. This cannot be anymore. My life cannot be crippled by anxiety and its toxic coping mechanisms any longer. No more porn. No more gonewild subs. No nothing. The next time I see a naked woman is gonna be when she's standing right in front of me, however long it takes.  [linebreak]  [linebreak] I'm done jerking myself into a coma, just like I'm done hiding from the world. I don't deserve to be treated this way *by my own self*, let alone anybody else. My mission to improve my life has gained a new facet and an extra shot in the arm. Telling my story on a public forum such as this is my way of owing it and drawing the dividing line between the past and the future. Thanks for reading. [linebreak]  [linebreak] tl;dr: Masturbated daily for twenty two years, used it as a crutch to avoid my anxiety, ran my social life into the ground, but fuck both of those things now. I'm in therapy and I'm gonna go out there and get mine.",

        "comment": "For background, I (25M) have been with my current girlfriend (21F) for nearly 2 years, and we have been going pretty well in terms of everything major. We rarely argue, we share very similar mindsets and interests, but the smaller differences are starting to affect me. [linebreak]  [linebreak]  [linebreak] I can say that she could be my future wife if she dropped a few habits, but I honestly don't see her doing so. She smokes cigarettes and does a lot of recreational drugs; cannabis, mdma, psychedelics, and has recently been interested in dmt. She has mild depression, diagnosed anxiety, and doesn't have any hobbies. Because she doesn't have any hobbies, she is always smoking marijuana daily, and she is always looking for the next opportunity to do mdma(once every few months) and I feel like her life is revolving around recreational drugs, albeit this is not heavy usage, purely to pass time. She is obsessed with having children and more pets, but at times her depression leads to neglect her current pets. She is insistent on having children in the future, but I can easily see the drug habits and depression affecting the well-being of her child and any future pets she wants to adopt. She does not see her drug problem as an issue, and says that she has the will to quit of necessary, but I don't believe her because I have seen how low her depression can pull her down. [linebreak]  [linebreak]  [linebreak] As for some background on myself, I'm a quiet introvert with a lot of hobbies, stable job with a mortgage, I occupy my time with various things, like home improvement, computer games and watching netflix. I also have a lot of creative art hobbies that I do from time to time. My view on recreational drugs is quite lax, I am aware that they do have inherent health risks and toxicity but this isn't the sub to discuss that. What I am willing to say is that I also enjoy recreational drugs from time to time, but I'd prefer it to be less frequent, and for it to not be the main focus of an activity.  [linebreak]  [linebreak]  [linebreak] Since being with my girlfriend, my drug usage has increased, and often times we will resort to smoking weed just to pass time. There is also a heavy expectation on me to sort out activities and entertainment for any given weekday, and she will complain loudly if not occupied. This will often default back to smoking more cannabis, which I'm not the greatest fan of.  [linebreak]  [linebreak]  [linebreak] I have suggested many times for her to adopt a hobby, but she dismisses this and continues to occupy her time with drugs, when I try to push the matter, she will need to smoke cigarettes to alleviate her stress. [linebreak]  [linebreak]  [linebreak] I honestly love my girlfriend, and I can see us staying together indefinitely if we stay on a similar path, but her insistence of a child conflicts with her cigarette and drug use. I would have no issues with her lifestyle if she didn't want a child; but as she is so clucky and unwilling to care for herself,  I feel that any child brought into this world will be in danger. [linebreak]  [linebreak]  [linebreak] I really don't know how to approach the matter, and I have been thinking about this for the longest time. I can't see her using less drugs, changing her mind about having a child, or picking up hobbies to occupy her time, and this is a major hurdle in our relationship. I can see us being best friends, and her having a child with another person, but I would still worry about the welfare of the kid, and breaking up and remaining mutual friends is always an idealistic situation that rarely works out. [linebreak]  [linebreak]  [linebreak] I just wanted this off my chest, I didn't come here for advice, but suggestions or comments about my/her lifestyle will be read. Thanks for reading.",

[linebreak]  [linebreak] I have fond memories of sitting in my mate's bedroom when we were both teenagers. I had Pink Floyd and Lamborghini posters on my bedroom walls. He had horror movie and death metal posters on his. I was so far out of my comfort zone but I was revelling in it. [linebreak]  [linebreak] I'm a lao fucker so this was pre-CD days. He had a record player in his bedroom and he was showing off / terrorising me with his favourite music. I distinctly remember a song called Hang the Pope by Nuclear Assault. I remember it because after playing it once at normal speed, he kicked it up to 45rpm (or maybe 78) and played it again and it was the funniest fucking thing I'd ever heard. [linebreak]  [linebreak] This is the song, in case you're curious.

You no longer loved me. I didn't need you anymore, so you no longer felt worth. That was so untrue. All I had ever wanted was to be be someone of lasting worth to you. In my quest to become a better spouse to you, I took away your power. I never meant to hurt you, but you couldn't find your place after I didn't need you to clean up my messes anymore. I can wish you had been different til the day I die, and it won't ever change the disappointment of my lifetime. You were supposed to be different. You were supposed to be my best friend.

She was musical, beautiful, kind, funny, intelligent, and she was not my wife.   [linebreak]  [linebreak] While my marriage was on the rocks at the time, and my wife wasn't around very much, we were still married.  It was a very dark time for me, but Margo was like a massive light that enveloped me and reminded me of who I was. [linebreak]  [linebreak] I think it's worth mentioning that Margo and I never slept together, however we absolutely developed real, and deep feelings for each other. [linebreak]  [linebreak] Anyway, eventually my wife finds out I've been connecting with Margo, and is (rightfully) furious.  There were a few tear filled nights, and some very hard conversations, but in the end, we decided to work things out.  I unceremoniously, (and with much difficulty and hesitation) ended contact with Margo.  I still feel horrible about how this all happened because she really was an amazing person who didn't deserve any of the drama I brought upon her. [linebreak]  [linebreak] So, my wife and I work things out, and things are better than they've ever been between us.  We re-found the love we had somehow lost, and are stronger because of everything that happened.  That being said, there was still always a part of me that was just.... empty and regretful.  Not because of how things turned out but because of the way they happened.  I was also worried about Margo, because for a long time I was her sounding board, and now, I couldn't help her. [linebreak]  [linebreak] Tonight I randomly decided to google Margo, and there was a video of her singing a brand new song, and parts of it were too specific to not be about what happened between us, but it gave me closure that everything is alright now. [linebreak]  [linebreak] It's late and I'm tired but happy. Even though this is a throwaway account I'm hoping this post just gets buried in the \"New\" pile. This was more for me than anything, because I don't really have anyone to talk to about this stuff, and posting it here feels like talking about it.

About 5 months ago after spreading myself incredibly thin trying to solve everyone else's problems in my clan, I meet someone who seems to just click with me. [linebreak]  [linebreak] No name but a letter. Anime pic. Everything should have told me this is a catfish. [linebreak]  [linebreak] But I was so fucking lonely. [linebreak]  [linebreak] It comes to be this person happens to be extremely rich on Runescape, and offered to give me 20 bonds for gold premier. [linebreak]  [linebreak] The catch? I had to give them the 7 bonds I had already, because \"It'll be a better gift if I give you all 20!\" [linebreak]  [linebreak] Of course I do so without thinking. [linebreak]  [linebreak] Trade complete. [linebreak]  [linebreak] B has left the clan. B has logged off. [linebreak]  [linebreak] I'm just sitting there staring at those words on my screen. [linebreak]  [linebreak] This must be a prank, right? No one would do that, be nice to someone then backstab them as soon as they get something, right? [linebreak]  [linebreak] 10 minutes pass. I haven't moved. One of my friends PM's me \"Why are you on that world?\" [linebreak]  [linebreak] All I could manage to say was \"I don't know.\" [linebreak]  [linebreak] I'd just gotten scammed because I was thinking with my dick. [linebreak]  [linebreak] I can't show my face to my clan anymore. They'll never let me live it down. I can't handle that. I'm supposed to be the clan mediator who helps everyone resolve issues. Not the completely broken mask that it actually is. [linebreak]  [linebreak] So I left. Never logged in again. On anything. Totally off the grid save my job. [linebreak]  [linebreak] A month goes by. My phone blares notifications at me... \"Naive we miss you.\" \"Naive, hope you're okay.\" \"Naive what happened?\" \"Naive we're really worried.\" [linebreak]  [linebreak] Lies. All lies. [linebreak]  [linebreak] About a month and a half ago, I finally summon the energy to go to the doctor. I just tell her right out I'm depressed. She prescribes me 200mg Bupropion, twice daily. [linebreak]  [linebreak] So now I'm on medication for depression. Doesn't feel like anything. [linebreak]  [linebreak] Until 3 weeks ago. [linebreak]  [linebreak] All of a sudden, I'm a completely different man. Garulous, entertaining, genuinely fun to talk to. Came back to my clan ecstatic. Things are looking good for once. [linebreak]  [linebreak] Except when you didn't agree with me. [linebreak]  [linebreak] Then I was the absolute hugest asshole in existence. Because how DARE someone try to harsh my happiness? [linebreak]  [linebreak] So I treat them like I would any other asshole. I mocked them. I poked fun at all the words they say. And when they inevitably fight back, I get underhanded. Start slinging shit that was told to me in confidence. [linebreak]  [linebreak] Of course they respond in kind. And then I played the victim. Dissected their words and arguments, completely contradicting myself at times just to win the argument. [linebreak]  [linebreak] Oh I won the arguments. But now the entire clan hates me. They don't even acknowledge me when I speak in the clan. [linebreak]  [linebreak] I've become *that* guy. The one you have to tip toe around on eggshells because he might snap and bite your head off. [linebreak]  [linebreak] I've become the crazy one. [linebreak]  [linebreak] I'm not fixed. Sure I'm no longer depressed. [linebreak]  [linebreak] But I've never felt more isolated than I do in this very moment. [linebreak]  [linebreak] They just wrote me off. I can't blame them. No one wants to deal with someone whose perception of reality is this fucked. [linebreak]  [linebreak] No one wants to hear out why I'm saying the things I say. No one is acknowledging that I said I need another break from Discord. No one cares. [linebreak]  [linebreak] So I left. Again. [linebreak]  [linebreak] I shouldn't be around people. I'm trash. Filth. The worst kind of asshole, the one that *has* to be right. [linebreak]  [linebreak] Don't end up like me. If you were depressed and now feel almost insanely good, see your doctor.

Instead of encouraging such behaviors, people should encourage them to get  the necessary medical help. [linebreak]  [linebreak] On top of that body positivity should be embracing your natural body type. Whether it be a pear, banana, apple, hourglass or etc. Fashion designers make different styles that cater to different body types. Its ridiculous when people get upset when an outfit doesn't look good on them, when its not for their body type to begin with. Embracing their body type is the best way to figure out what makes them look beautiful. Like wearing a size 4 when they're really a size 14. Not only do they make themselves look bad but it gives them a harder/very uncomfortable time forcing themselves in spanx and corsets. Do yourself a favor and wear clothes that work for you, don't wear it just bc its what so and so wore or its what society wants. Everyone is beautiful or handsome in their own unique ways.

I learned to cut down tall trees and turn them into small logs for her.  I learned to repair cars for her.  I took her wherever she wanted go.  Plays, vacations, concerts, art shows, festivals.  Some days I would actually sit on the riding mower and think about how lucky I was. [linebreak]  [linebreak] Then my wife suffered an aneurysm.  I spent 10 days shuttling between the hospital with my wife and the home with our kids.  Whatever she wanted I brought to her.  Whatever the kids needed, they got.  The balls stayed in the air. [linebreak]  [linebreak] In the months following her release,  I took care of her like a nanny.  Whatever she wanted she got.  She wanted a new car.  We got her the top of the line package.  She wanted a new TV.  She wanted a new laptop.  She wanted new clothes and a new kitchen.  Done and done and done and done and done. [linebreak]  [linebreak] She entered peri-menopause.  Everything that she could not control became Enemy.  She became paranoid.  She obsessed over the minutes between my end of work and when I got home.  She obsessed over my daily mileage.  An extra tenth of a mile or an extra minute meant that I was fucking the neighbor.  She claimed that I tricked her into buying the new car and the new kitchen when she was weak.  We did not have sex for the final three years of cohabitation.  [linebreak]  [linebreak] The kids began to suffer.  She became increasingly volatile and violent.  Many times I came home to a broken interior door or a hole in a wall.  If I was home I had to be ready to get between my wife and my children at the drop of a hat.  He rmother pleaded with her to get professional help.  Our pastor pleaded with her to seek professional help.  I agreed to see a therapist with her and, after our third session, the therapist told her that she should seek help from a PhD level neuropsychologist.   [linebreak]  [linebreak] Eventually the kids moved out of the house.  She demanded that I remove them from my will.  She demanded that I stop supporting them in any way.  I was to stop their annual gifts.  i was to stop paying for their health insurance.  She threatened to call my HR department, pretending to be me, and remove them from my benefits.  She stole tens of thousands of dollars from their accounts and was charged with multiple felonies.  My children asked the prosecutor to go lightly on their mother and the charges were dropped after she returned their money. [linebreak]  [linebreak] Eventually she filed for a TRO because she claimed that I was stalking her.  I moved out and filed for divorce. [linebreak]  [linebreak] I have offered to give her everything.  The house that is nearly paid off and easily sold or refinanced.  The cars that are paid off.  Every single piece of movable property.  All I want in return is my retirement.  I just want to be shut of her.  She refuses to respond to my offer. [linebreak]  [linebreak] She has filed for disablilty benefits so that she can receive spousal support.  She has filed for multiple TROs, all denied.  Denied but costly to the defendant.  If one stuck I would probably lose my job.  [linebreak]  She is hell-bent on bankrupting me even though it bankrupts her, too.

[linebreak]  [linebreak] I'm not happy, I can't remember the last time I was, and I'm not sure I even know what I need to be happy with my life. I don't know what to do. I've been on antidepressants, and I still feel this way. Sometimes I have good days or good weeks, but I usually end up completely melting down and losing it again over something. I don't know how to make it better or if I even can. [linebreak]  [linebreak] I can't afford to move out. I can't afford to rent where I live, I certainly can't afford to buy a house or a flat, and I don't see a way out. Every time I'm reminded of the lifestyle my parents had at the same age as me, it upsets me because I know I'll never have that, it's going to pass me by. I don't even know why I want to emulate them in that way because they're divorced now. I'm scared that down the line I'm going to feel like I've missed a whole chapter of my own life. [linebreak]  [linebreak] My girlfriend broke up with me a year ago. She did the worst thing that anyone has ever done to me, I don't forgive her and I never will. I find it hard to meet people and I thought she was going to be it for me. I still miss her and I think I'm probably going to carry this for the rest of my life. She didn't just take away the relationship, she took away all the hopes and dreams I had for being a proper functioning adult and being happy. What's really bothering me about it right now is that I ruined things - before they even started - with another girl who liked me and who I liked too, to be with her. This absolutely is my fault and even if it probably wouldn't have worked out with her I spend far too much time thinking about if I blew my chance at being happy with someone. [linebreak]  [linebreak] I hate my job. If you told me tomorrow that it was gone and I could never go back, I wouldn't care. Wouldn't give one single solitary fuck. I hate the building, I hate the place it's in, I hate the noise, I hate the customers, I hate all of it. I could just find a new job and leave, but I feel so completely ground down and I don't think I would find anything better so I can't motivate myself to. I could go back to university and learn to do something else but not without getting myself into a lot of debt I'll never be able to pay off. [linebreak]  [linebreak] I've never wanted to have a real job, because I can't handle the real world. As a kid I dreamed of being an athlete, although it became clear pretty early on that I was never going to be. I love sports but I'm just not good enough to even play at a recreational level, and that kills me and I don't enjoy them as much as I would like because of that. Then I started to pursue music, and I was OK at that, but I just can't do it. I can't meet other people who share the same musical aspirations as me, I can't write a song because nothing comes out when I try to, I just can't get it right. [linebreak]  [linebreak] I can't stop obsessing over things that I can't change. I can't stop obsessing over perfection and trying to obtain it. I can't stop obsessing over how all kinds of small details in my life are wrong. I can't feel part of anything. I can't even build a set of fucking shelves.

[linebreak]  [linebreak]  [linebreak] Times Higher Education is published by the Wall Street Journal, a highly reputable newspaper, and historically has been one of the most excellent sources of news with the most talented writers, along with the most knowledgeable experts in their corresponding fields. Look at how many famous successful journalists work for them. The Wall Street Journal is also one of the world's largest circulated weekly news source and features a variety of top-notch content. [linebreak]  [linebreak]  [linebreak] US News, beside their \"ranking,\" is a garbage little newspaper company, and only sounds prestigious due to their name. Nearly no famous/influential people work for them. They have a terrible track record and are truly a laughingstock if you investigate the state of the company. Since they do not release their data to the public, their rankings may just be a pure fraud, as the results that they get do not agree well with reference standard rankings that are calculated using legitimate methodology.

I was threatened with being reported to the admins there as well, yet, here I still am. Because, guess what? I didn't make the report.

Would you really want to buy some candy or mixed nuts that you knew people had been touching all day? No you wouldn't because thats fucking gross, unsanitary, and slightly nauseating. I used to care enough to stop people, but I quickly learned (on my first day) that if I dropped what I was doing to stop folks from sticking their hands in my product I would never get any work done. It's seriously an all day thing and often happens back to back. [linebreak]  [linebreak] Shame on you woman who sneezed into her hand and then grabbed some almonds.

[linebreak]  [linebreak] In late January, my dad had a massive heart attack and almost died before his 50th birthday. He had 3 clogged arteries, 100%, 85% and another 70 ish %. My heart was so fucking crushed when I saw him the ICU, all pale, IVs sticking out every which way, and a giant feeding tube shoved down his throat. That week, was probably the worst week in my entire life.  [linebreak]  [linebreak] All in the months of May and June; my childhood dog died at 13, right before her birthday in July. [linebreak]  [linebreak] I had to re-home my lizard because I am moving and she means literally so much to me. I fucking bawled even thinking about her leaving my home. Luckily she went to a good family friend, but it's like parting from my child for me. [linebreak]  [linebreak] I got into a big fight with my old best friend and they said some really cruel and nasty things about me and I honestly don't know when that wound will heal for me. [linebreak]  [linebreak] My therapist from since I was 2 years old, has cancer. It rapidly approached and in just a month she went from active and clear headed, to being at the point where she can no longer take care of herself and needs daily assistance. [linebreak]  [linebreak] During this entire year, I think I've been abusing a substance, using it as a crutch. I want to get help, but I also don't want to necessarily stop altogether. [linebreak]  [linebreak] So basically that was my year (so far). I have to admit, there have been some really wonderful things that have happened, but it's hard to enjoy them. I mean, this year will always be branded into my brain (The most being my father's near death experience).

[linebreak]  [linebreak] My grandparents owned a large chunk of and island with 4 cabins in Georgian Bay. This was their cottage, and their children and grandchildren were able to go up any time they wanted in the summer. And we did. My grandparents loved having everyone up, and everyone loved being up there. The big dock, the kayaks, the boat the grandkids could use whenever they wanted, the cool water, the beautiful sunsets, this place was heaven. When it was my grandparents cottage, their 3 kids were equal in how many times you could go up, the rules were the same, and everyone was welcome whenever they wanted.  [linebreak]  [linebreak] Everything changed when my grandparents passed away. [linebreak]  [linebreak] My grandfather had cancer which took over his body quickly. So while he was still alive he put the cottage on sale, and we all went up one more time. It was nice closure. We all said our goodbyes to this place that held so many memories in our hearts. And then my aunt and uncle decided to buy it. They promised everyone nothing would change, we could all go up whenever we wanted, etc. But that wasn't realistic. Their kids, my cousins, have first dibs when it comes to going up. If their kids bring friends, there's no room for the other 2 families. If my aunt and uncle bring their friends, same thing applies. I don't have an issue with this, because it's their cottage. What I have an issue with is the constant stream of Instagram stories and posts every weekend of them renovating cabins, photos of the sunsets, or photos of them relaxing on the dock. Recently they posted a photo of them driving around in a boat that was so sentimental to my grandfather he never let any drive it. And there they were in bikinis and drinks sitting on the back driving it around. Seeing all of this makes me upset. They have every right to enjoy their own cottage, but it's just insensitive of them to constantly post about their great weekends up there when the other 2 families who used to enjoy the same things only get to see it through a smartphone. [linebreak]  [linebreak] I just wish they would be able to enjoy their new cottage without having to show all of us how much fun they're having. Without showing us how each cabin is now one child's mini house. How a cottage which could hold over 20 people can now only fit 8. I want to forget about this place, but I can't. I'm constantly being reminded of my grandparents and feeling huge waves of nostalgia.",

I had been to this one once before and as soon as I walked in the ward I felt safe again. It was home. [linebreak]  [linebreak] One of the counselors there and I got very close. I'm ashamed to say he was everything I looked for in a person, not even in a sex/love way.As a kid I dreamed about a knight in shining armor, and he was exactly that. [linebreak]  [linebreak] He would talk to me personally every night, staying after his shift ended. I remember one night opening up to him about the abuse after all patients had gone to bed. He stayed so late that night, and I told him \"go home. You have a kid.\" He told me \"I'm not leaving until I know you're safe. Those people are never allowed to visit. We'll report them together. I always knew there was more you weren't telling me, and now everything makes sense. It's okay. You're safe here, and I'm not letting anything else happen to you.\" He said he didn't do all this for anyone. [linebreak]  [linebreak] Locked wards have very strict rules, and I broke them frequently. I slowly got all privileges taken away for multiple incidents. I would sleep in a chair next to the nurses station. I was only allowed to use crayons, since I abused pens.  [linebreak]  [linebreak] But this counselor bent the rules and I was allowed to have my guitar. He knew how to play and would hold down the strings for me so I could have a capo. I played for relaxation most nights, and other patients would stay up just to listen. [linebreak]  [linebreak] Before I left, he told me \"the only way I'm ever allowed to hear about you, or see you on the news is if you get famous for music.\" Meaning, he didn't want to hear that I had killed myself.  [linebreak]  [linebreak] It's been so long, but sometimes I pray to him. I hope he gets the message and knows somehow I'm still breathing. I want him to know I've kept my promise.

        "comment": "A little story time. Who's up for some context?! [linebreak]  [linebreak] This started a few years ago, when I was big into writing fanfic - something I'm trying to get myself back into eventually. I write for a fairly niche fandom; it's not *small,* but it's also not terribly active these days, either. I'd made a few acquaintances through it, either way. [linebreak]  [linebreak] One of these was a woman roughly my age - let's call her \"Jill.\" We kind of hit it off, being active and discussing the series on one of the message boards; we liked and left feedback on each others' stories, chatted a bit in private. We bonded over personal stuff, a bit, too. And for the curious, this was a platonic thing - I'm a gay guy, she's a straight(?) married woman. [linebreak]  [linebreak] Anyway, we wind up being friends on Facebook, and I think that may be where the trouble started. [linebreak]  [linebreak] Thing is... I know what it's like to *be* clingy. I've had to deal with the fallout from it in the past, and it's something I've really tried to work on, something I get very self-conscious about whenever I make a new friend. In the past, I've had friends who would say nothing about it until they reached a breaking point, and then they'd be pretty harsh about it when the dam finally broke. [linebreak]  [linebreak] The point of this is that... Jill was quite clingy herself. It came about pretty quickly after a certain point. Like, within less than half a year of our knowing each other. [linebreak]  [linebreak] She knew my working hours, but she'd constantly message me to talk when she knew I'd be sleeping, or getting ready to go to work, or *at* work. Or when she knew I was trying to take time to myself to do something else - gaming, writing, whatever. Sometimes I'd talk a bit, or tell her I'd talk to her later when I had a chance (like if I needed to get ready for work, or bed, or something). If we went more than a few days without talking too much, regardless of the reason, she'd kind of guilt trip me over it. \"I missed talking to you,\" \"It feels like it's been so long since we talked,\" et cetera... mind that it was generally maybe 3 or 4 days at most between conversations. She'd also get down on herself, and I can't tell if she was being manipulative or what. \"I know I'm probably boring/annoying/not much fun to talk to. I'm a wreck.\" Things like that. I don't know how to respond to stuff like that other than just \"No you're not\" or whatever. I'm not good with that stuff. She knew that. [linebreak]  [linebreak] I did try to be tactful and point out to Jill - more than once - that while I enjoyed talking to her, hey, I had to sleep, or work, or get ready for work, and I had other stuff I needed to get done. I didn't want to outright *say* \"You know I have a life outside of you, right?\", but then again... maybe I should've? [linebreak]  [linebreak] Either way, she kinda ramped it up. Asking for my address so she could send me stuff I'd mentioned offhand (I mentioned in a Facebook post that I was gonna save up to buy a keyboard, she offered to send me one if I'd give her my address - and it was at a point where I wasn't comfortable with the idea). Trying to find new excuses to strike up conversation (\"I had a dream that something terrible happened to you, so message me when you get this, because I get freaked out over stuff like that\") even though we'd spoken only a day or two ago. [linebreak]  [linebreak] Eventually, I got tired of Jill not getting it, and got so uncomfortable with her and her clinginess persisting despite my stated discomfort with it, that I ghosted her. Blocked her on [Fanfiction.net](https://Fanfiction.net), blocked her on Facebook, on my phone. I was getting really stressed out from dealing with her. And maybe I should've been more sympathetic, because I'd been her before. I'd been that person whose co-dependent nature pushed people away. But even seeing a notification from her stressed me out majorly. She seemed to want me to be her therapist (never mind I have a ton of my own issues to deal with), to be on-call for her when she was lonely (never mind that she has a husband she seems to love deeply and was always praising him), and so on. [linebreak]  [linebreak] Apparently, after I ghosted her, Jill took it pretty hard for a while. [linebreak]  [linebreak] Thing is... this was over a year ago. You'd think she'd have maybe moved on a little since then, yeah? She has other friends, as far as I know, that she really gets along with well, too. She seems more social. [linebreak]  [linebreak] Except, last week, another writer we were both friends with (I'll call her \"Claire\") PMed me on [Fanfiction.net](https://Fanfiction.net). Mostly to say hi, let me know a new game was coming out in the series that we all wrote for, that she was excited and all that. We weren't all that close, but she'd message me periodically to chat. I respond, say \"hey, Claire, I'm excited too, sorry I've been so quiet lately but I had a lot to deal with recently, hope to get back to writing soon.\" [linebreak]  [linebreak] She responds, says she hopes so too, and also, \"Hey, why don't you drop Jill a line? She's really missed you this past year.\" [linebreak]  [linebreak] So, apparently, Jill still doesn't get that I'm not comfortable talking to her, and despite my pointing it out multiple times, she doesn't get that I wanted space and boundaries and stopped talking to her because she didn't respect those. So, now I'm anxious again, even though I don't have to interact with her if I don't want to. I just wish she'd move on and stop clinging to me. I have no idea *why* she even clung to me to begin with. It's just irritating. [linebreak]  [linebreak] TL;DR: Extremely clingy and codependent friend drove me off because she didn't respect that I needed space, and she's still clinging to me over a year after we stopped talking.",

I thought they were making a joke about the pulp character Zorro at first, but that is literally what his property is named.  [linebreak]  [linebreak] Realizing this, I was reminded of something I'd heard Random Rants of Ryan talk about. It's one of the examples of \"pizza\" being used as a suspicious code to hide corruption, and the news article about this that I linked above predates \"pizzagate\" by months. I remembered that another code that went unexplained there was \"zorro\". They used these codes, \"pizza\" and \"zorro\", to hide corruption, and we know about this from way back in July 2016. Meanwhile, \"pizzagate\" hit the scene months later after John Podesta's emails were released by WikiLeaks, and they also contained coded messages about \"pizza\".  [linebreak]  [linebreak] I haven't seen anyone else connect these dots, but what are the chances these connections are mere coincidence? People always focus on Epstein's island in the Caribbean, and apparently locals called it \"pedophile island\", but maybe there is something worth looking at going on in New Mexico too. Anyone have any ideas for what \"Zorro\" might mean? It's Spanish for fox if that means anything to anyone.",

County Road, the former Abe Gosman estate, to Russian fertilizer mogul Dmitry Rybolovlev.  [linebreak] The sale of the 6-acre estate was announced in May [linebreak]  [linebreak] >Although Trump calls it a $100 million deal, the deed lists the sale price as $95 million. Trump, in a call from his office in New York, said the higher figure includes closing costs. The documentary stamps for the deed came to $665,000. [linebreak]  [linebreak] >The real estate developer and reality TV star said reports that he spent $25 million to renovate the mansion are false. Construction permits issued since he bought the property in 2004 have a listed value of $502,470, according to Jackie Kervey, records manager for the Town of Palm Beach.  [linebreak] \"I always looked at it as a teardown,\" Trump said. [linebreak]  [linebreak] Okay, so the next article: [linebreak]  [linebreak] http://web.archive.org/web/20160404183943/https://www.palmbeachdailynews.com/news/business/real-estate/the-story-behind-the-95-million-mansion-tear-down/nqxyW/#cmComments [linebreak]  [linebreak] This is from April 2016 and says the property was now going to be demolished, I guess it went unused for eight years? Idk, it's kinda vague.  [linebreak]  [linebreak] There's a weird quote in here from Trump: [linebreak]  [linebreak] >In the same interview, Trump said he wasn't sure whether his Russian buyer planned to actually live in the house. \"I'd imagine it'd be for a home but I don't know, other than I know he made a great deal. I think time will prove that out,\" Trump said. [linebreak] And had the deal not gone through? Trump had a backup plan: \"I'd be very serious about building a world-class hotel (on the property),\" he said a couple of months before the transaction closed. \"I know our Palm Beach fathers are thrilled about that.\" [linebreak]  [linebreak] Uhhh... wut [linebreak]  [linebreak]  [linebreak] By the way, both of those articles are scrubbed from the internet, except for the archives. [linebreak]  [linebreak] So the owners of this property from earliest to latest were: [linebreak]  [linebreak] -Jayne and Charles Wrightsman, socialites and art collectors (1947-1985) [linebreak]  [linebreak] -Leslie Wexner, retail mogul and Jeffrey Epstein's only known financier (1985-1988) [linebreak]  [linebreak] -Abe Gosman, healthcare mogul (1988-2004) [linebreak]  [linebreak] -Donald Trump (2004-2008) [linebreak]  [linebreak] -Dmitry Rybolovlev, fertilizer mogul (2008-present?)

But she had changed her mind and forever lived with that guilt.  [linebreak]  [linebreak] She didn't enjoy it, and after it started, she wanted it to stop, but felt trapped. She gave me some pretty descriptive details.  [linebreak]  [linebreak] The real horrible bit. She didn't make him wear a condom. He pulled out, but this happened at the time we conceived my son.  [linebreak]  [linebreak] She had a paternity test a year after, (while i was indisposed) and it confirmed (98% odds off) that Steve was not the father.  [linebreak]  [linebreak] So there is no... true damage? I'm sticking with her. She has changed. Like i said i knew something was off, just not that horrible.  [linebreak]  [linebreak] Currently part of me is so disgusted, and the other frustrated. Not to sound Cliché, but I'm not mad at her, just so deeply disappointed.

And I mean, I'm not hideous, I've turned down quite a few guys for not being up to my standards (not solely based on looks, but lack of chemistry) or treating me like a piece of meat. [linebreak]  [linebreak] I've been with my current bf for almost 5 years, I fell head over heels the first time I saw him. We just so happen to have great chemistry, the same views on sex, he's good in bed, and he's well-endowed on top of being my best friend who I find incredibly attractive. ( I know) I've had bad sex before and seen how pushy and gross some guys can be, why would I throw this away to make sure I'm not missing anything? I'd rather masturbate than ever have empty sex with someone who doesn't care about me",

        "comment": ">I really wish we could get to the genesis of the hatred of bigger people. [linebreak]  [linebreak] As with all societal trends it's complicated but I think media plays the most significant role.  [linebreak]  [linebreak] Movies, TV, advertising... everyone looks a certain way. Even non visual mediums like books and radio will *describe* people as having these certain looks.  And heck, you can see this even in how very body-positive overweight people dress/do their makeup.... they're still copying all the styles popularized by people of a more normal weight.  [linebreak]  [linebreak] I don't think that makes the body positive overweight people hypocrites though, which people will want to do... instead I think it just shows how unbelievably pervasive media and societal perceptions of beauty really are. Even a person claiming to be body positive will have makeup that mimics what you might see on a celebrity.  [linebreak]  [linebreak] There is an element of health involved. No doubt, being overweight is generally less healthy... obesity is not the way the human body naturally should end up... but I think that's so buried beneath the cultural elements that I find it generally hard to believe most people when they claim their fat people hate comes from beliefs about health and wellness.  [linebreak]  [linebreak]  [linebreak] >The average size of Americans has gotten larger overall, yet there seems to be a particular hatred for big people I cant wrap my head around. [linebreak]  [linebreak] So I actually have noticed less hatred for fat people in the past 5 years or so, perhaps owing to the increasing size of Americans. At this moment, some 2/3rds of Americans are overweight or obese.  [linebreak]  [linebreak] However, there's also an element one commenter pointed out that is clearly on display in this AITA post: self-hate/self-loathing... the overweight girl very likely is quite ashamed and sensitive about her size and is using the sassy, in-your-face body positivity as a cover... and I'm sure that many of the people shitting on fat people online are themselves overweight.  [linebreak]  [linebreak]  [linebreak]  >Mysogyny is wrapped up in it as well of course. [linebreak]  [linebreak] Absolutely. Especially I think in the sort of middle-range of being bigger... if you're slightly overweight as a guy, it's much more acceptable than being slightly overweight as a girl.  [linebreak]",

Sure its annoying when people who are literally dying from obesity are shouting at you that they are healthy at any size which of course is one the dumbest thing I've ever heard. Really, are we going to pretend anorexia and bulimics are healthy? No, so we should not pretend that people who weigh 300 pounds are healthy either, there is not a single piece of evidence that being fat is good for you, while there is literal mountains of evidence that being in good shape with low body fat is associated with health and longer life. [linebreak]  [linebreak] I really don't see this hatred of the overweight you speak of, just because someone isn't attracted to you and doesn't want any type of relationship with you due to your inability to take care of yourself does not mean they hate all fat people. Personally I would never be with someone who is not in good shape, for a few simple reasons. 1) I take excellent care of my body and physical activity is a passion of mine, so if my s/o isn't into an active lifestyle we just wont match. 2) I want a life partner who isn't going to die in the first 50 years of their life from cancer or heart disease. 3) I'm just not physically attracted to overweight people, plain and simple, doesn't make me a bad person for having a personal preference. I work extremely hard for my low body fat % and muscles and it makes me happy, I'm much more confident, outgoing and energetic when im taking care of my body.",

We (I am one as well) are a real thing, it's determined by your nervous system, which in HSPs is more developed than average. Almost 20% of people are HSP's and also there happen to be highly sensitive ones among animals. It serves a purpose, because they are more sensitive not only emotionally, but also sensually, so they are more likely to notice if something is wrong. Highly sensitive animals are the guards because of that. It used be so with humans before we could depend on technology to be safe and sound. Anyway, I consider high sensibility as some super power and with great power comes great responsibility. [linebreak] I'm not implying that you are HSP, but doing some research on that topic might be really helpful, because HSPs and Ausies share a lot in characteristics.

But that doesn't mean that the pain they're suffering is less \"bad\" for them - as you said. Because that's how they perceive and feel it, so that's absolute reality for them, even if objectively the issue isn't as bad. They still have to live through it. They have to go through the exact pain someone less sensitive would have to go through because of an objectively worse issue. (Most?) People experience life subjectively. The limit to feeling a certain amount of pain for someone sensitive might be lower than for someone less sensitive. But it doesn't mean it's less real, it doesn't mean they're in need of less support and understanding and empathy. It's the same, felt, pain. Often, a sensitive person will feel happiness quicker and easier too. Does that mean they are, really, less happy than a less sensitive person?

[linebreak]  [linebreak] RULE 0: Be Civil [linebreak] Let's keep the talk and discussion on what ever the subject matter of the post may be. Resorting to personal quarrels and arguments that may use insults and other tribal-like behaviors will be deleted. Keep it civil. [linebreak]  [linebreak] RULE 1: Correct Formatting [linebreak] The requirements for posting to this subreddit is to have a self contained opinion within the title. The text will be used to expand and elaborate on why you think/feel this way. You may also include why you think this is an unpopular or controversial opinion. [linebreak]  [linebreak] RULE 2: Opinion must be unpopular/controversial [linebreak] This sub isn't just opinions, but unpopular and/or controversial ones. If your opinion has been posted to the subreddit recently, chances are it'll get removed. SO PLEASE SEARCH BEFORE SUBMITTING. [linebreak]  [linebreak] RULE 3: No Reposts/Search Before Submitting [linebreak] If essentially the same opinion gets reposted it'll automatically mean it's not an unpopular opinion (within the context of the sub). It WILL get removed. If your opinion is about a ongoing event, there will usually be a mega thread where you can discuss there. [linebreak]  [linebreak] RULE 4: No Spam [linebreak] New accounts are subject to a 24 hour waiting period before posting. Spamming will usually result to a perma ban. [linebreak]  [linebreak] RULE 5: No Trolling [linebreak] Trolling is saying random unsolicited things that only serve to invoke a knee jerk reaction. Trolls will usually get permanently banned. [linebreak]  [linebreak] RULE 6: Elaborate [linebreak] An important rule in this subreddit is that all opinions must be elaborated on. There is a discussion to be had, so please expand on what you have said. [linebreak] Your post must contain more than 160 characters (roughly two or three standard sentences) to avoid auto-deletion by automod. [linebreak]  [linebreak] RULE 7: Hate posts are not allowed [linebreak] Opinion can be unpopular unless it's blatantly a hateful post. Hostile, rude and aggressive behavior is not a necessity to express your opinion. Please be civil and and have respect. Bear in mind that justifying or endorsing pedophilia activities (sidenote: discussion on treatments of the mental health itself is fine), rape, race issues, assault or other similar crimes will usually count as hate speech. This does not mean you'll get banned for saying one crime is not as severe as another or saying you can understand why someone would commit a crime. Race baiting is a ban-able offence [linebreak]  [linebreak] RULE 8: No Low Effort/Satire Posts [linebreak] Any opinion that is not thought out well or posts that clearly have very little effort put into them will be removed. This also includes commonly posted opinions to the subreddit. Please note that obscure topics and meta commentaries on the subreddit do not constitute a valid unpopular opinion post.\"",

[linebreak] the problematic part is not the inclusion of a revived, politically significant, openly racist and fascist (sorry to anyone who don't know this, but the rise of so-called \"populism\" you see on the right is a rise of fascism, read a book) confederacy in WW2, but rather the prospect of individual players identifying with the confederacy and what such play indicates and consists in. is it okay to role play as lynching thugs? [linebreak] it's a deep question, honestly. contextualized properly, one can do interesting things with it. other art forms employ genuine antiheroes (like tony soprano, who is, simply, a psychopath) and do good things (criticize capitalism, and the emotional/intellectual dissociation involved with immoral behavior both localized and structural/systemic). what does \"I'M the character\" do to change it? in a book, we're often in the person's mind. their thoughts replace ours in a focused narrative. is that alright? will i become a psychopath if i read such media? [linebreak] i don't know. i think it merits discussion, but the statement the guy made sounds fine to me. are they cashing in on the rise of the alt-right and open white supremacy in america? i don't know. do we want to allow role playing games and alternate reality media? that one, i'm pretty comfortable with yes. we need to do deeper, broader, better things to eliminate white supremacists than make sure they can't role play as the confederacy joining WW2.

        "comment": "**Cyclists need to be aware on the road** [linebreak]  [linebreak] I learned to ride a motorcycle. This is something that is not really mentioned but is wholly related. Obviously, cars are a huge risk to those who ride a motorcycle for the same reasons cyclists. [linebreak]  [linebreak] What you're taught as a motorbike rider, the most important lesson, is that you're responsible for you. You cannot rely on a driver to be looking out for you. Not because they don't want to but because, like cyclists, you're less visible. Cars have blind spots and you can't expect them to always see you. [linebreak]  [linebreak] The second most valuable lesson is that motorcyclists tend to make better drivers because they're more aware on the road and responsible for their driving decisions. They're more concerned about reacting to other drivers decisions rather than driving on autopilot and going, \"oopsie\" when something unexpected happens.  [linebreak]  [linebreak] Being aware of your surroundings as a cyclist or motorcyclist is still essential to safety. [linebreak]  [linebreak]   [linebreak]  [linebreak] **Cyclists need to be aware on footpaths (sidewalks)** [linebreak]  [linebreak] A car is predictable. In most cases, a car will be on the road. Unless it's pulling out of a driveway it's very rare to see a car that isn't on the road and it's impossible to see a road and not know that a motor-vehicle will use that road. Driving has rules. You stick to the designated areas and should there be any reason to be where a pedestrian might walk you look and wait for any to pass.  [linebreak]  [linebreak] The same isn't said for footpaths (or sidewalks I think it's called where you are), bike tracks and cyclists. [linebreak]  [linebreak] This is the case in many places here that both footpaths and bike tracks are shared by pedestrians and cyclists. It doesn't make sense to me either but basically, there are footpaths that just end in bike tracks and force pedestrians to use the bike track to get from point A to B. This usually isn't a big problem and pedestrians on a bike track are automatically more aware of the possibility of a cyclist. (If ever a reason to have ***more*** bike tracks exists, this is not a bad one at all) [linebreak]  [linebreak] The problem is the unpredictability of cyclists and a lack of presence.  [linebreak]  [linebreak] A cyclist, here at least, is in no way predictable. A pedestrian will use a footpath, a car will use a road and a cyclist will use whatever is convenient at the time. With a lack of presence, it's impossible to know if you'll even see a cyclist on that day. Together you end up with both drivers and pedestrians not being able to anticipate if or when a cyclist is going to be there or how they're going to behave. This means a cyclist has to be more aware of their surroundings than the pedestrian as the pedestrian has no way of knowing how to react even when aware of the cyclist due to the unpredictability of the situation. In my experience with cyclists, there is no definitive answer to \"how do I avoid a pedestrian\". Some move to one side of the footpath, some ride on the road, some ring their bell so you can move out of their way and some creepily follow behind at a slow pace without ringing their bell until you notice and step out of their way like they expect you to be psychic or something. That last category is the jerks.  [linebreak]  [linebreak] Unlike with cars, there isn't some set rule that applies to all cyclists and pedestrians and unlike bike tracks, you can't stay aware of things you're unlikely to encounter. [linebreak]  [linebreak] The solution to this is actually having more bike tracks and cyclists rather than less. [linebreak]  [linebreak]   [linebreak]  [linebreak] I overthought the ***fuck*** out of this and strayed way beyond the original point of the thread.",

[linebreak]  [linebreak] I'm assuming that there would be multiple \"healthcare providers\", i.e., those who procure actual healthcare products and services, not insurance companies (who I assume would be eliminated by Medicare-for-all).

When a victim of a crime comes forward, the people that they trust should absolutely support them, and help them get help and try to make it as easy as possible to get the police involved - not necessarily influence them to go to the authorities, but that's where crimes *should* go, for a number of reasons. [linebreak]  [linebreak] This becomes a less tenable position when a) the justice system gets involved and b) when there are real world consequences for leveling an accusation. [linebreak]  [linebreak] With the Jussie Smollett case, we see both of those in play.  When the police investigation unfolded, they were able to put forth compelling evidence against his claim.  The second set is more nuanced, but this is how I see it:  His claims had a major effect to divide the country.  Seeing these claims would have such an effect, it gives us good reason to scrutinize his story.  When we scrutinize the story, we find some major holes (two maga people out after 2 in intensely cold weather, in Chicago, apparently knowing where Smollett was, and being prepared for that confrontation, his refusal to hand over his phone, he walked home and waited 40 minutes or so before calling the police) and we have a good reason to step back a bit from the narrative and wait for an investigation to conclude before deciding. [linebreak]  [linebreak] In short, believe all victims is a good idea, but it becomes more nuanced when there are real consequences that may hurt or jail others, at which time we should scrutinize the story or let the professionals do their job.",

[linebreak]  [linebreak] - His foreign affairs look great to me. You haven't said much that I can respond to, but he's against excessive military force and the war on terror. If he applies the same morality to international affairs that he applies to internal, I feel like he's definitely in good shape. The campaigning candidate is different from the elected candidate but hopefully we'll see.  [linebreak]  [linebreak] - He has a better grasp on economics than the majority of politicians that I've observed. Gutting the working class to subsidize the rich is never going to work but until he started stirring up shit, it seemed like almost all Democratic politicians were right on board for that. Glad that's changing.  [linebreak]  [linebreak] - As far as being an easy opponent do destroy, he's the Democratic frontrunner with lots of grassroots support. Hillary wasn't able to completely wipe him out even after getting the nomination. It's not 2020 yet, but enthusiasm for him has remained pretty stable since 2016. Grassroots support was one of the keys to Obama's success and the Democratic party itself has adjusted its metrics for candidate eligibility to include that, so he's ticking a lot of the right boxes for that party overall.
