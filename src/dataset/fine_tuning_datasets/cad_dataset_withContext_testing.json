I agree in some capacity, but I feel like it's not quite so straightforward. \n \n I feel that there can be a pushback towards criticism of phones and the internet that's misguided and as heavy handed as the criticism itself, but I think it's important to examine why that is. \n \n Some of it is probably denial, and an effort to protect one's behavior/lifestyle, but I think a lot of it comes from incredibly misguided and generalizing criticism from older generations. \n \n Boomers and above who do look down on and judge younger generations are rarely making poignant critiques. I get there's a sense of a severe scapegoating for any number of reasons, and the Internet tends to be what's focused on, even if it's not actually where the sense of disagreement stems from. Whether it's generational differences, a sense of alienation, or what have you, it seems like phones are often the decided culprit. \n \n Maybe it'd make sense to challenge the motives of the criticism instead of wholeheartedly defending current tech trends, but it can feel so condescending to be regarded as less than and have that judgement cast allegedly bc we are involved w current tech trends. Disagreeing with and roasting those shallow critiques can feel p vindicating. \n \n But, yes, current technology is addictive. Some of it seems to be how we function around the stimuli, but a lot of it is designed into the product. Which to me seems like something overlooked. A lot of the blame cast seems to be accusing us of addiction, and a lot of the defense against it seems to be denying it. Maybe we could do better by acknowledging that these issues are intentionally curated by people in positions of power. \n \n Wow that's a lot of text. Thanks for coming to my ted talk",

It means that we are all deserving of anothers love for what makes us unique. Yes there are bad people out there.

And I can't believe that what set me off today was not being able to find part of a fucking IKEA cabinet. \n \n I'm not happy, I can't remember the last time I was, and I'm not sure I even know what I need to be happy with my life. I don't know what to do. I've been on antidepressants, and I still feel this way. Sometimes I have good days or good weeks, but I usually end up completely melting down and losing it again over something. I don't know how to make it better or if I even can. \n \n I can't afford to move out. I can't afford to rent where I live, I certainly can't afford to buy a house or a flat, and I don't see a way out. Every time I'm reminded of the lifestyle my parents had at the same age as me, it upsets me because I know I'll never have that, it's going to pass me by. I don't even know why I want to emulate them in that way because they're divorced now. I'm scared that down the line I'm going to feel like I've missed a whole chapter of my own life. \n \n My girlfriend broke up with me a year ago. She did the worst thing that anyone has ever done to me, I don't forgive her and I never will. I find it hard to meet people and I thought she was going to be it for me. I still miss her and I think I'm probably going to carry this for the rest of my life. She didn't just take away the relationship, she took away all the hopes and dreams I had for being a proper functioning adult and being happy. What's really bothering me about it right now is that I ruined things - before they even started - with another girl who liked me and who I liked too, to be with her. This absolutely is my fault and even if it probably wouldn't have worked out with her I spend far too much time thinking about if I blew my chance at being happy with someone. \n \n I hate my job. If you told me tomorrow that it was gone and I could never go back, I wouldn't care. Wouldn't give one single solitary fuck. I hate the building, I hate the place it's in, I hate the noise, I hate the customers, I hate all of it. I could just find a new job and leave, but I feel so completely ground down and I don't think I would find anything better so I can't motivate myself to. I could go back to university and learn to do something else but not without getting myself into a lot of debt I'll never be able to pay off. \n \n I've never wanted to have a real job, because I can't handle the real world. As a kid I dreamed of being an athlete, although it became clear pretty early on that I was never going to be. I love sports but I'm just not good enough to even play at a recreational level, and that kills me and I don't enjoy them as much as I would like because of that. Then I started to pursue music, and I was OK at that, but I just can't do it. I can't meet other people who share the same musical aspirations as me, I can't write a song because nothing comes out when I try to, I just can't get it right. \n \n I can't stop obsessing over things that I can't change. I can't stop obsessing over perfection and trying to obtain it. I can't stop obsessing over how all kinds of small details in my life are wrong. I can't feel part of anything. I can't even build a set of fucking shelves. I can't have all the time back that I've wasted. I can't cope. \n \n And I feel like an entitled little prick for being bothered by these things as much as I am.",

Does it contain hate speech against people with disabilities? https://www.businessinsider.com/socgen-codewords-pizza-zorro-men-in-black-libyan-fund-2016-7 \n \n https://www.curbed.com/2015/1/9/10004040/jeffrey-epstein-property-real-estate-holdings \n \n I heard someone talking about Epstein's New Mexico property, and they called it \"Zorro ranch\". I thought they were making a joke about the pulp character Zorro at first, but that is literally what his property is named. \n \n Realizing this, I was reminded of something I'd heard Random Rants of Ryan talk about. It's one of the examples of \"pizza\" being used as a suspicious code to hide corruption, and the news article about this that I linked above predates \"pizzagate\" by months. I remembered that another code that went unexplained there was \"zorro\". They used these codes, \"pizza\" and \"zorro\", to hide corruption, and we know about this from way back in July 2016. Meanwhile, \"pizzagate\" hit the scene months later after John Podesta's emails were released by WikiLeaks, and they also contained coded messages about \"pizza\". \n \n I haven't seen anyone else connect these dots, but what are the chances these connections are mere coincidence? People always focus on Epstein's island in the Caribbean, and apparently locals called it \"pedophile island\", but maybe there is something worth looking at going on in New Mexico too. Anyone have any ideas for what \"Zorro\" might mean? It's Spanish for fox if that means anything to anyone.",

It's alright if you say the murderer acted like a yandere character would, I'd also say it's cool, albeit a bit cringy, if you're watching a movie or series where a character kills someone over jealously and you call that a yandere. \n \n But in the context of real life with real people, unless you're making a dark joke, you shouldn't really be calling a murderer via an anime stereotype because it's innacurate. Yandere is a thing in anime because of the context the media is built. \n \n In the same manner, traps don't mind being called traps because they don't exist, it doesn't help increase hate crime rate of anime characters if you address them by that term, and 'trap' has a use for anime community because it identifies characters that do not fall correctly under the trans nor crossdresser label. The problem is that anime culture reached out way outside it's bubble and people that have no idea what the term reffers to started using it wrongly. \n \n A trans person would be someone born in the wrong body, they feel the other gender and have the need to be more like the other gender. \n \n A crossdresser is a person that is of a gender but likes dressing up as the other gender from time to time. \n \n What the term trap tries to define are anime characters that dress up and act like another gender, and sometimes even go as far as saying they feel like the gender they're going by, but doesn't actually suffer from gender dysphoria. What makes this term not really useable for real people is the fact that you can never assume a person isn't suffering from gender dysphoria because *they* are the only ones able to tell what they're suffering from, as with a fictional character it's entirely alright to assume they aren't suffering from something if the narrative doesn't imply they are. \n \n That being said, people will keep both misusing the term and misinterpreting it, and while I'm against completely banning the term (I mean, did that ever work...?) I won't pretend I have a solution to this.",
