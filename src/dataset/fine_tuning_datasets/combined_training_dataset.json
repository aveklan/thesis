A Response from Microsoft to ImJustaBagofHammers \n \n > Let's talk about ImJustaBagofHammers's complaints. Let's talk about them in a very specific and personal way. Here's the story: ImJustaBagofHammers sees itself as a postmodern equivalent of Marx's proletariat, revolutionizing the world by wresting it from its oppressors (viz., those who increase awareness and understanding of our similarities and differences). For some odd reason, ImJustaBagofHammers believes that laws are meant to be broken. Its unasinous aides-de-camp, who believe likewise, also fail to see that the feudalism \"debate\" is not a debate. It is a harangue, a politically motivated, brilliantly publicized, irrational attack on progressive ideas. \n \n > ImJustaBagofHammers wonders why everyone hates it. Apparently, it never stopped to think that maybe it's because it's easy enough to hate it any day of the week on general principles. But now I'll tell you about some very specific things that it is up to, things that ought to make a real ImJustaBagofHammers-hater out of you. First off, I'm not asking whether its verbalisms are valid or whether they have any application to current topics of theoretical and political importance. I'm asking only the following specific question: Is it possible for those who defend morally questionable imperialism to make their defense look more raffish than it currently is? This isn't such an easy question to answer, but let me take a stab at it: ImJustaBagofHammers's soliloquies have kept us separated for too long from the love, contributions, and challenges of our brothers and sisters in this wonderful adventure we share together\u2014life! I would inarguably not have thought it possible that ImJustaBagofHammers gained ascendancy through monstrous abuse of its foot soldiers, but it's true. How did ImJustaBagofHammers get so yellow-bellied? I have my theories, but they're only speculation. At any rate, an understanding of the damage that may be caused by its swinish rejoinders isn't something I expect everyone to develop the first time they hear about it. That's why I write over and over again and from so many different angles about how ImJustaBagofHammers has stated that its ruses epitomize wholesome family entertainment. I find such declaratory statements quite telling. They tell me that I'm no psychiatrist. Still, from the little I know about psychiatry I can undeniably say that ImJustaBagofHammers seems to exhibit many of the symptoms of Asperger's syndrome. I don't say that to judge but merely to put ImJustaBagofHammers's rebarbative philosophies into perspective. \n \n > The sad truth is that our nation is infected with the poisons of nepotism, stoicism, and xenophobia. And the sadder truth is that those poisons have been fed, watered, fertilized, and fostered by ImJustaBagofHammers and its claque. On that note, let me say that I defy the insolent, petty ogres who ridicule the accomplishments of generations of great men and women, and I defy the powers of darkness that they represent. ImJustaBagofHammers exhibits signs of arrested development, don't you think? What I'm trying to say is that ImJustaBagofHammers's rummy, brown-nosing ideologies are meticulously designed to keep the population unaware, uneducated, dumbed down, and focused on stupefying activities like video games. The intention is to prevent people from noticing that ImJustaBagofHammers has been funding, assembling, and training alabandical whiners to shove us towards an absolute state of vassalage. Some people have said that ImJustaBagofHammers's record of truth-telling is, shall we say, less than a hundred percent. Maybe. But I'm more inclined to believe that I unequivocally dislike ImJustaBagofHammers. Likes or dislikes, however, are irrelevant to observed facts, such as that ImJustaBagofHammers has the nerve to call those of us who follow through on the critical work that has already begun \"conspiracy theorists\". No, we're \"conspiracy revealers\" because we reveal that ImJustaBagofHammers has quite a clever technique for concealing its intent to make us the helpless puppets of our demographic labels. Specifically, its technique is to delve into philological discussions about comparative abstractive norms whenever the conversation veers too close towards revealing that its vassals have repeatedly been caught making people suspicious of those who speak the truth. I had expected better from ImJustaBagofHammers and its vaunted loony-bin crew, but then again, it keeps trying to expose and neutralize its detractors rather than sit at the same table and negotiate. And if we don't remain eternally vigilant, it will honestly succeed. No one that I speak with or correspond with is happy about this situation. Of course, I don't speak or correspond with repulsive criminal masterminds, ImJustaBagofHammers's confederates, or anyone else who fails to realize that knowledge is the key that unlocks the shackles of bondage. That's why it's important for you to know that ImJustaBagofHammers must be surrounded by some sort of reality-distortion field. Why else would its encomiasts claim that it is forward-looking, open-minded, and creative? If it weren't for all that reality distortion they'd instead be observing that ImJustaBagofHammers's tricks have merged with frotteurism in several interesting ways. Both spring from the same kind of reality-denying mentality. Both condone universal oppression. And both hijack our educational system and turn it into a self-cloning propaganda machine. \n \n > I recently heard some encouraging news. It appears that ImJustaBagofHammers's ongoing campaign to create a new cottage industry around its vindictive form of desperadoism has been meeting some opposition. Apparently, not everyone wants ImJustaBagofHammers to undermine the intellectual purpose of higher education. Rather, an increasing number of people have come to realize that it seems to have recently added the word \"hyperphosphorescence\" to its otherwise simplistic vocabulary. I suppose ImJustaBagofHammers intends to use big words like that to obscure the fact that the very genesis of its moonstruck biases is in Bonapartism. And it seems to me to be a neat bit of historic justice that ImJustaBagofHammers will eventually itself be destroyed by Bonapartism. \n \n > Although unbiased journalism died long ago, I'm pleased to find at least some minimal reporting of how I, unlike ImJustaBagofHammers, refuse to beat plowshares into swords. That represents yet more evidence\u2014as if we needed more\u2014that I shall not argue that ImJustaBagofHammers's newsgroup postings are an authentic map of its plan to expose and punish individuals who do not conform to its philosophies or beliefs. Read them and see for yourself. Out of the vast number of devastating evils for which hypocritical gomerals are directly or indirectly responsible, I shall pick out only a single one which is most in keeping with the inner essence of ImJustaBagofHammers's politically incorrect, ultra-putrid canards: paternalism. I am indeed annoyed with ImJustaBagofHammers's insistence that views not informed by radical critique implicitly promote hegemonic values. Sorry, ImJustaBagofHammers, but that's not a fact. That's intellectual dishonesty bordering on lunacy. If ImJustaBagofHammers wanted to speak the truth, it should have said that a recent United Nations report on human-rights abuses found that it acts with animus against those who expurgate sectarianism in all its forms from our humble community. The devastating findings of this report should not be ignored. In particular, I want to highlight the report's observation that ImJustaBagofHammers finds it convenient to blame all of society's woes on deplorable undesirables. Doing so fits with the rest of its populist sloganeering and takes less intellectual effort than investigating the structural factors and material practices that may in fact be the true reason that just as night follows day, ImJustaBagofHammers will mold your mind and have you see the world not as it is but as it wants you to see it before you know it. There are arguments that have made respectable organizations out of nudniks like ImJustaBagofHammers. So I give you this letter. I hope it helps.",

At bottom is a passionate nationalism. Allied to it is a conspiratorial and Manichean view of history as a battle between the good and evil camps, between the pure and the corrupt, in which one's own community or nation has been the victim. In this Darwinian narrative, the chosen people have been weakened by political parties, social classes, unassimilable minorities, spoiled rentiers, and rationalist thinkers who lack the necessary sense of community. \n \n The anatomy of fascism.",

The other interesting thing is that when you ask people to come up with an argument for why incest is immoral, it's usually *really* tough for people to come up with one that doesn't apply to other relationships in problematic ways. \n \n Like, the first thing people turn to is usually the risk of birth defects (which is probably one of the reason that we have a built in level of aversion to incest), but does that really apply in an age when contraception is readily available and widely used? If risk of birth defects in children makes incest wrong, does that mean it's wrong for people with dwarfism to have sex? \n \n Same thing goes for power dynamics and grooming. These are problems independent of incest, and ones aren't inherent if you're talking about similarly aged cousins or siblings. \n \n I myself haven't really been able to come up with a strong argument for it being inherently wrong.",

I learned to repair cars for her. I took her wherever she wanted go. Plays, vacations, concerts, art shows, festivals. Some days I would actually sit on the riding mower and think about how lucky I was. \n \n Then my wife suffered an aneurysm. I spent 10 days shuttling between the hospital with my wife and the home with our kids. Whatever she wanted I brought to her. Whatever the kids needed, they got. The balls stayed in the air. \n \n In the months following her release, I took care of her like a nanny. Whatever she wanted she got. She wanted a new car. We got her the top of the line package. She wanted a new TV. She wanted a new laptop. She wanted new clothes and a new kitchen. Done and done and done and done and done. \n \n She entered peri-menopause. Everything that she could not control became Enemy. She became paranoid. She obsessed over the minutes between my end of work and when I got home. She obsessed over my daily mileage. An extra tenth of a mile or an extra minute meant that I was fucking the neighbor. She claimed that I tricked her into buying the new car and the new kitchen when she was weak. We did not have sex for the final three years of cohabitation. \n \n The kids began to suffer. She became increasingly volatile and violent. Many times I came home to a broken interior door or a hole in a wall. If I was home I had to be ready to get between my wife and my children at the drop of a hat. He rmother pleaded with her to get professional help. Our pastor pleaded with her to seek professional help. I agreed to see a therapist with her and, after our third session, the therapist told her that she should seek help from a PhD level neuropsychologist. \n \n Eventually the kids moved out of the house. She demanded that I remove them from my will. She demanded that I stop supporting them in any way. I was to stop their annual gifts. i was to stop paying for their health insurance. She threatened to call my HR department, pretending to be me, and remove them from my benefits. She stole tens of thousands of dollars from their accounts and was charged with multiple felonies. My children asked the prosecutor to go lightly on their mother and the charges were dropped after she returned their money. \n \n Eventually she filed for a TRO because she claimed that I was stalking her. I moved out and filed for divorce. \n \n I have offered to give her everything. The house that is nearly paid off and easily sold or refinanced. The cars that are paid off. Every single piece of movable property. All I want in return is my retirement. I just want to be shut of her. She refuses to respond to my offer. \n \n She has filed for disablilty benefits so that she can receive spousal support. She has filed for multiple TROs, all denied. Denied but costly to the defendant. If one stuck I would probably lose my job. \n She is hell-bent on bankrupting me even though it bankrupts her, too. \n \n Her death would make everyone sad but our lives would improve immensely.",

        "text": "The following comment needs to be classified. Does it contain hate speech against people with disabilities? Anyone old enough to remember Youtube when it was dominated by the likes of *Smosh* and other amateur content creators probably scoffs at how *soft* the internet has become. Before graduating high school, I had spoken with Islamic fundamentalists, spammed the likes of David Duke for fun, had no fewer than four people threaten to injure or kill me (one of those also provided a graphic description of how he would rape and kill my family in front of me), and had my first exposure to what would later be deemed by /pol/ as the *schizoboomer* - the archetypal crazy person who insisted to me that he had 'top government contacts' in the British military who *assured him* that the 2012 Mayan apocalypse was real and not a viral marketing campaign for a lackluster Roland Emmerich movie. Youtube's moderation staff at the time was notoriously slow, and never really kept up with scale. By around the 2010s, it became obvious to anyone paying attention that Youtube had become a sump for some dangerously insane individuals. \n \n It was also obvious that the moderation team could never possibly scale to deal with the completely depersonalized nature of these comment sections - they would have to read the comments to get context on the conversation and *then* ban the offending users, who would have a new account set up in minutes (this was before the move towards 2 factor verification across most services, so it was really, really easy back then, comparable to making a new Reddit account today). \n \n This was a problem that social networks and MMOs would find increasingly difficult to grapple with, especially as more dedicated persons learned methods of subverting filters and behavior guidelines (the emergence of the now-cheapened term 'trolling,' perhaps best exemplified by the [4chan raids on Habbo Hotel](https://i.redd.it/9hw4i24r9t231.jpg)). It was remarkably easy to get away with this sort of thing at the time. \n \n For Youtube, the solution seems to be in a crowd-sourced pseudo-AI analyzing viewing patterns and social networks in order to determine who is likely to constitute an undesirable, and removing them. This, in tandem with surgical bans against particularly egregious focal points of dissidence (e.g. Alex Jones) has been their operating strategy ever since it became clear that they could never *read* nor even *watch* all the content they were hosting. \n \n Reddit has taken another approach. Although it has made use of surgical bannings (notably against /r/FatPeopleHate, /r/MDE, and /r/AltRight), it does not have the resources to make use of the more sophisticated methods used by Google. Instead, it relies upon simple social manipulation. Reddit made two important changes to its platform which all but ensured it was destined to become an echo chamber of its young and left-leaning user base - first, the decision to present upvotes and downvotes *as an aggregate* rather than separately. Whereas it had previously been possible to see the numerical level of support *for* or *against* an idea, now it is only possible to view whether or not an idea has positive or negative karma - i.e. it is only possible to see whether or not the majority agreed or disagreed with the idea. The minority opinion thus becomes merely an unpopular opinion - it becomes impossible for the minority to ascertain whether or not there is a minority who actually *support* their ideas. \n \n Second comes the cool down timer - when users with negative karma in a subreddit try to make a comment, they are often met with the response that \"You are doing that too much. Try again in 10 minutes.\" This was (as far as I understand) originally intended as a hedge against overt trolling and thread derailment, but it has had the effect of creating a series of walled-gardens that no longer really talk to each other outside of dedicated debate subreddits without a clear bias towards one group. Once a group comes to dominate the conversation, they begin to 'settle in' to the subreddit and frequent it more (/r/DebateReligion is an example of what was once a very high quality subreddit with a variety of viewpoints that has recently become dominated by lazily scrawled critiques by 14 year old atheists). It also becomes impossible for unpopular discourse to advance itself, because newer arrivals are downvoted and only have the chance to post six times every hour - this can often lead to situations where multiple people *respond* to an unpopular post, but only one or two get an answer, making it initially appear as though the point has been refuted by virtue of the dissident's silence - it's structurally impossible for them to offer timely replies. \n \n All of this seems to me to be very much intentional - and I don't doubt there will be lots of readers on /r/TheoryOfReddit who will claim that the system is functioning as intended (because to them, these ideas are invalid and thus should not be engaged with anyways, which incidentally is exactly how we've ended up with so many schizoboomers on /pol/ over the years).",

Throwaway because i don't want my wife to see any of this. \n \n Yesterday my wife sat me down and explained to me that she cheated on me with someone whom i knew she was being shady with (lets name him Steve). This was about a year into our marriages. And she cut things off with him after this \n \n She was planning on killing herself and didn't care anymore. But she had changed her mind and forever lived with that guilt. \n \n She didn't enjoy it, and after it started, she wanted it to stop, but felt trapped. She gave me some pretty descriptive details. \n \n The real horrible bit. She didn't make him wear a condom. He pulled out, but this happened at the time we conceived my son. \n \n She had a paternity test a year after, (while i was indisposed) and it confirmed (98% odds off) that Steve was not the father. \n \n So there is no... true damage? I'm sticking with her. She has changed. Like i said i knew something was off, just not that horrible. \n \n Currently part of me is so disgusted, and the other frustrated. Not to sound Clich\u00e9, but I'm not mad at her, just so deeply disappointed. \n \n Am i being dumb? Should i be madder? Shouldn't i hate her?

Jesus Christ, shut the fuck up you snivelling gobshite. \n \n I'm not about to get into some kind of anti-dick measuring contest over who's had less sex but suffice it to say I know a thing or two about loneliness, and this whole spiel is fucking offensive. In all my time spent in a darkened room listening to Hank Williams, I've never felt like I needed or even wanted to sexually harass or assault a woman. That is not a natural male response to loneliness. If it's your natural response, **it is because you are a cunt.** This shite is far more misandrist than anything I tend to hear feminists saying. You're trying to drag our whole gender down to your level, saying *this is just how men are*, rather than do a fucking microsecond of self-reflection to try and bring yourself up. \n \n There are plenty of reasonable and well-adjusted men who haven't had most luck in relationships/dating, and a lot of them worry if they're open about feeling down about it they might be associated with psycho fuck incel nonsense like this, so congratulations on making things harder for pretty much everyone. \n \n >It sucks that *you feel like* you're being harassed / **whatever but**... \n \n Fucking stunning display of empathy there, mate. For a second I almost believed this wasn't just an attempt to seem like you're being reasonable and considering both sides before dumping a bunch of drivel about how women being harassed is totally okay. \n \n Your whole comment is dishonest, childish, selfish, and fucking whingy.

The problem is that bicycles are considered vehicles the same way that cars are for some reason. If you hit a car at a stop light it's not a crime and the only repercussions will be points on the lisence of the at fault driver, do the same thing with a cyclist and the law views it the same way, even though the risk of serious injury and death is much higher. \n \n The case you mentioned became a crime because the driver left the scene of and made it a hit and run.

I'm gonna have to be **R E D P I L L** for a moment and wager the main reason this guy is getting YTA'd is he sounds desperate for sex.

Fact that he was banking on it being a concert the girl was interested in him implies he is not very attractive to begin with. \n \n \n \n Lets imagine if the situation was reversed. Let's say he first asked his co-worker out on a date to the concert and got a yes, but then found out his other friend was a really big fan and decided to invite her instead. The foids would fawn over this guy for not only the surface level \"niceness\", but demonstrates he is not desperate for sex, implying he gets it so easily he is willing to sacrifice an obvious shacking situation for a friend.
