All Arab, Muslim countries and their residents should see and understand this ugly face of racist Hindus. They are the overwhelming majority in India and number of votes cast to BJP-RSS party is a proof . It amazes me that Saudi Arabia and other gulf countries are spending billions on India and not seeing that how much they hate Islam and Muslims? Particularly Arabs, wake up. If you can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t understand this now then when or what will make you? Let all Muslims be united and boycott Indian products, their restaurants and movies, until they stop killing Muslims in Kashmir and the rest of India, and make a law to stop anti Muslim hate and racism.",
